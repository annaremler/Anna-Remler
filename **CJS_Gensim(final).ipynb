Warner_, at the _Black-Boy_ in\\n_Pater-Noster-Row_, 1724.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTHE PREFACE.\\n\\nH_AVING taken more than ordinary Pains in collecting the Materials\\nwhich compose the following History, we could not be satisfied with our\\nselves, if any Thing were wanting to it, which might render it entirely\\nsatisfactory to the Publick: It is for this Reason we have subjoined to the\\nWork, a short Abstract of the Laws now in Force against Pyrates, and made\\nChoice of some particular Cases, (the most curious we could meet with)\\nwhich have been heretofore tried, by which it will appear what Actions\\nhave, and what have not been adjudged Pyracy._\\n\\n_It is possible this Book may fall into the Hands of some Masters of Ships,\\nand other honest Mariners, who frequently, by contrary Winds or Tempests,\\nor other Accidents incident to long Voyages, find themselves reduced to\\ngreat Distresses, either through Scarcity of Provisions, or Want of Stores.\\nI say, it may be a Direction to such as those, what Lengths they may\\nventure to go, without violating the Law of Nations, in Case they should\\nmeet other Ships at Sea, or be cast on some inhospitable Shore, which\\nshould refuse to trade with them for such Things as are absolutely\\nnecessary for the Preservation of their Lives, or the Safety of the Ship\\nand Cargoe._\\n\\n_We have given a few Instances in the Course of this History of the\\nInducements Men have to engage themselves headlong in a Life of so much\\nPeril to themselves, and so destructive to the Navigation of the trading\\nWorld; to remedy which Evil there seems to be but two Ways, either to find\\nEmployment for the great Numbers of Seamen turn'd adrift at the Conclusion\\nof a War, and thereby prevent their running into such Undertakings, or to\\nguard sufficiently the Coast of _Africa_, the _West-Indies_, and other\\nPlaces whereto Pyrates resort._\\n\\n_I cannot but take Notice in this Place, that during this long Peace, I\\nhave not so much as heard of a _Dutch_ Pyrate: It is not that I take them\\nto be honester than their Neighbours; but when we account for it, it will,\\nperhaps, be a Reproach to our selves for our want of Industry: The Reason I\\ntake to be, that after a War, when the _Dutch_ Ships are laid up, they have\\na Fishery, where their Seamen find immediate Business, and as comfortable\\nBread as they had before. Had ours the same Recourse in their Necessities,\\nI'm certain we should find the same Effect from it; for a Fishery is a\\nTrade that cannot be overstock'd; the Sea is wide enough for us all, we\\nneed not quarrel for Elbow-room: Its Stores are infinite, and will ever\\nreward the Labourer. Besides, our own Coast, for the most Part, supply the\\n_Dutch_, who employ several hundred Sail constantly in the Trade, and so\\nsell to us our own Fish. I call it our own, for the Sovereignty of the\\n_British Seas_, are to this Day acknowledged us by the _Dutch_, and all the\\nneighbouring Nations; wherefore, if there was a publick Spirit among us, it\\nwould be well worth our while to establish a National Fishery, which would\\nbe the best Means in the World to prevent Pyracy, employ a Number of the\\nPoor, and ease the Nation of a great Burthen, by lowering the Price of\\nProvision in general, as well as of several other Commodities._\\n\\n_I need not bring any Proofs of what I advance, _viz._ that there are\\nMultitudes of Seamen at this Day unemploy'd; it is but too evident by their\\nstraggling, and begging all over the Kingdom. Nor is it so much their\\nInclination to Idleness, as their own hard Fate, in being cast off after\\ntheir Work is done, to starve or steal. I have not known a Man of War\\ncommission'd for several Years past, but three times her Compliment of Men\\nhave offer'd themselves in _24_ Hours; the Merchants take their Advantage\\nof this, lessen their Wages, and those few who are in Business are poorly\\npaid, and but poorly fed; such Usage breeds Discontents amongst them, and\\nmakes them eager for any Change._\\n\\n_I shall not repeat what I have said in the History concerning the\\nPrivateers of the _West-Indies_, where I have taken Notice they live upon\\nSpoil; and as Custom is a second Nature, it is no Wonder that, when an\\nhonest Livlyhood is not easily had, they run into one so like their own; so\\nthat it may be said, that Privateers in Time of War are a Nursery for\\nPyrates against a Peace._\\n\\n_Now we have accounted for their Rise and Beginning, it will be natural to\\nenquire why they are not taken and destroy'd, before they come to any Head,\\nseeing that they are seldom less than twelve Men of War stationed in our\\nAmerican Plantations, even in Time of Peace; a Force sufficient to contend\\nwith a powerful Enemy. This Enquiry, perhaps, will not turn much to the\\nHonour of those concern'd in that Service; however, I hope I may be\\nexcus'd, if what I hint is with a Design of serving the Publick._\\n\\n_I say, 'tis strange that a few Pyrates should ravage the Seas for Years,\\nwithout ever being light upon, by any of our Ships of War; when in the mean\\nTime, they (the Pyrates) shall take Fleets of Ships; it looks as if one was\\nmuch more diligent in their Affairs, than the other. _Roberts_ and his\\nCrew, alone, took 400 Sail, before he was destroy'd._\\n\\n_This Matter, I may probably set right another Time, and only observe for\\nthe present, that the Pyrates at Sea, have the same Sagacity with Robbers\\nat Land; as the latter understand what Roads are most frequented, and where\\nit is most likely to meet with Booty, so the former know what Latitude to\\nlie in, in order to intercept Ships; and as the Pyrates happen to be in\\nwant of Provisions, Stores, or any particular Lading, they cruise\\naccordingly for such Ships, and are morally certain of meeting with them;\\nand by the same Reason, if the Men of War cruise in those Latitudes, they\\nmight be as sure of finding the Pyrates, as the Pyrates are to find the\\nMerchant Ships; and if the Pyrates are not to be met with by the Men of War\\nin such a Latitude, then surely down the same Latitude may the Merchant\\nShips arrive safely to their Port._\\n\\n_To make this a little plainer to my Country Readers, I must observe that\\nall our outward bound Ships, sometime after they leave the Land, steer into\\nthe Latitude of the Place they are bound to; if to the _West-India_\\nIslands, or any Part of the Main of _America_, as _New-York_,\\n_New-England_, _Virginia_, _&c._ because the Latitude is the only Certainty\\nin those Voyages to be found, and then they sail due West, till they come\\nto their Port, without altering their Course. In this West Way lie the\\nPyrates, whether it be to _Virginia_, _&c._ or _Nevis_, _St. Christophers_,\\n_Montserat_, _Jamaica_, _&c._ so that if the Merchant Ships bound thither,\\ndo not fall a Prey to them one Day, they must another: Therefore I say, if\\nthe Men of War take the same Track, the Pyrates must unavoidably fall into\\ntheir Mouths, or be frighted away, for where the Game is, there will the\\nVermin be; if the latter should be the Case, the trading Ships, as I said\\nbefore, will pass unmolested and safe, and the Pyrates be reduced to take\\nRefuge in some of their lurking Holes about the uninhabited Islands, where\\ntheir Fate would be like that of the Fox in his Den, if they should venture\\nout, they would be hunted and taken, and if they stay within they must\\nstarve._\\n\\n_I must observe another Thing, that the Pyrates generally shift their\\nRovings, according to the Season of the Year; in the Summer they cruise\\nmostly along the Coast of the Continent of _America_, but the Winters\\nthere, being a little too cold for them, they follow the Sun, and go\\ntowards the Islands, at the approach of cold Weather. Every Man who has\\nused the _West-India_ Trade, knows this to be true; therefore, since we are\\nso well acquainted with all their Motions, I cannot see why our Men of War\\nunder a proper Regulation, may not go to the Southward, instead of lying up\\nall the Winter useless: But I shall proceed too far in this Enquiry, I\\nshall therefore quit it, and say something of the following Sheets, which\\nthe Author may venture to assure the Reader that they have one Thing to\\nrecommend them, which is Truth; those Facts which he himself was not an\\nEye-Witness of, he had from the authentick Relations of the Persons\\nconcern'd in taking the Pyrates, as well as from the Mouths of the Pyrates\\nthemselves, after they were taken, and he conceives no Man can produce\\nbetter Testimonies to support the Credit of any History._\\n\\n_It will be observed, that the Account of the Actions of _Roberts_ runs\\ninto a greater Length, than that of any other Pyrate, for which we can\\nassign two Reasons, first, because he ravaged the Seas longer than the\\nrest, and of Consequence there must be a greater Scene of Business in his\\nLife: Secondly, being resolved not to weary the Reader, with tiresome\\nRepetitions: When we found the Circumstances in _Roberts_'s Live, and other\\nPyrates, either as to pyratical Articles, or any Thing else, to be the\\nsame, we thought it best to give them but once, and chose _Roberts_'s Life\\nfor that Purpose, he having made more Noise in the World, than some\\nothers._\\n\\n_As to the Lives of our two female Pyrates, we must confess they may appear\\na little Extravagant, yet they are never the less true for seeming so, but\\nas they were publickly try'd for their Pyracies, there are living Witnesses\\nenough to justify what we have laid down concerning them; it is certain, we\\nhave produced some Particulars which were not so publickly known, the\\nReason is, we were more inquisitive into the Circumstances of their past\\nLives, than other People, who had no other Design, than that of gratifying\\ntheir own private Curiosity: If there are some Incidents and Turns in their\\nStories, which may give them a little the Air of a _Novel_, they are not\\ninvented or contrived for that Purpose, it is a Kind of Reading this Author\\nis but little acquainted with, but as he himself was exceedingly diverted\\nwith them, when they were related to him, he thought they might have the\\nsame Effect upon the Reader._\\n\\n_I presume we need make no Apology for giving the Name of a History to the\\nfollowing Sheets, though they contain nothing but the Actions of a Parcel\\nof Robbers. It is Bravery and Stratagem in War which make Actions worthy of\\nRecord; in which Sense the Adventures, here related will be thought\\ndeserving that Name. _Plutarch_ is very circumstantial in relating the\\nActions of _Spartacus_, the Slave, and makes the Conquest of him, one of\\nthe greatest Glories of _Marcus Crassus_; and it is probable, if this Slave\\nhad liv'd a little longer, _Plutarch_ would have given us his Life at\\nlarge. _Rome_, the Misstress of the World, was no more at first than a\\nRefuge for Thieves and Outlaws; and if the Progress of our Pyrates had been\\nequal to their Beginning; had they all united, and settled in some of those\\nIslands, they might, by this Time, have been honoured with the Name of a\\nCommonwealth, and no Power in those Parts of the World could have been able\\nto dispute it with them._\\n\\n_If we have seem'd to glance, with some Freedom, at the Behaviour of some\\nGovernors of Provinces abroad, it has been with Caution; and, perhaps, we\\nhave, not declar'd as much as we knew: However, we hope those Gentlemen in\\nthe same Station, who have never given Occasion for the like Censure, will\\ntake no Offence, tho' the Word Governor is sometimes made use of._\\n\\nP. S. _It will be necessary to add a Word or two to this Preface, in order\\nto inform the Reader, that there are several material Additions made to\\nthis second Impression, which swelling the Book in Bulk, must of\\nConsequence add a small Matter to its Price._\\n\\n_The first Impression having been received with so much Success by the\\nPublick, occasioned a very earnest Demand for a second: In the mean Time,\\nseveral Persons who had been taken by the Pyrates, as well as others who\\nhad been concerned in taking of them, have been so kind to communicate\\nseveral Facts and Circumstances to us, which had escaped us in the first\\nImpression. This occasioned some Delay, therefore if we have not brought it\\nout, as soon as wish'd, it was to render it the more compleat._\\n\\n_We shall not enter into a Detail of all the new Matter inserted here, but\\nthe Description of the Islands _St. Thome_, _&c._ and that of _Brasil_ are\\nnot to be passed by, without a little Notice. It must be observed, that our\\nspeculative Mathematicians and Geographers, who are, no doubt, Men of the\\ngreatest Learning, seldom travel farther than their Closets for their\\nKnowledge, _&c._ are therefore unqualified to give us a good Description of\\nCountries: It is for this Reason that all our Maps and Atlasses are so\\nmonstrously faulty, for these Gentlemen are obliged to take their Accounts\\nfrom the Reports of illiterate Men._\\n\\n_It must be noted also, that when the Masters of Ships make Discoveries\\nthis Way, they are not fond of communicating them; a Man's knowing this or\\nthat Coast, better than others, recommends him in his Business, and makes\\nhim more useful, and he'll no more discover it than a Tradesman will the\\nMystery of his Trade._\\n\\n_The Gentleman who has taken the Pains to make these Observations, is _Mr.\\nAtkins_, a Surgeon, an ingenious Man in his own Profession, and one who is\\nnot ty'd down by any narrow Considerations from doing a Service to the\\nPublick, and has been pleased generously to communicate them for the good\\nof others. I don't doubt, but his Observations will be found curious and\\nvery serviceable to such as Trade to those Parts, besides a Method of Trade\\nis here laid down with the _Portuguese_, which may prove of great Profit to\\nsome of our Countrymen, if followed according to his Plan._\\n\\n_It is hoped these Things will satisfy the Publick, that the Author of the\\nfollowing Sheets considered nothing so much as making the Book\\nuseful;--tho' he has been informed, that some Gentlemen have rais'd an\\nObjection against the Truth of its Contents, _viz._ that it seems\\ncalculated to entertain and divert.--If the Facts are related with some\\nAgreeableness and Life, we hope it will not be imputed as a Fault; but as\\nto its Credit, we can assure them that the Sea-faring Men, that is all that\\nknow the Nature of these Things, have not been able to make the least\\nObjection to its Credit:--And he will be bold to affirm, that there is not\\na Fact or Circumstance in the whole Book, but he is able to prove by\\ncredible Witnesses._\\n\\n_There have been some other Pyrates, besides those whose History are here\\nrelated, such as are hereafter named, and their Adventures are as\\nextravagant and full of Mischief, as those who are the Subject of this\\nBook.--The Author has already begun to digest them into Method, and as\\nsoon, as he receives some Materials to make them compleat, (which he\\nshortly expects from the _West-Indies_). If the Publick gives him\\nEncouragement he intends to venture upon a second Volume._\\n\\nTHE CONTENTS.\\n\\nINTRODUCTION.\\n\\nT_HE Danger of Commonwealths from an Increase of Pyrates_, 17.\\n_Pyrates in the Times of_ Marius _and_ Sylla, 18. _Takes_ Julius Cæsar, 19.\\n_The Barbarity of those Pyrates_, ib. _They spare_ Cæsar, _and why_, ib.\\n_His Behaviour amongst them_, ib.

We shall not\\nexamine how it came to pass, that our Pyrates in the _West-Indies_ have\\ncontinually increased till of late; this is an Enquiry which belongs to the\\nLegislature, or Representatives of the People in Parliament, and to them we\\nshall leave it.\\n\\nOur Business shall be briefly to shew, what from Beginnings, as\\ninconsiderable as these, other Nations have suffered.\\n\\nIn the Times of _Marius_ and _Sylla_, _Rome_ was in her greatest Strength,\\nyet she was so torn in Pieces by the Factions of those two great Men, that\\nevery Thing which concerned the publick Good was altogether neglected, when\\ncertain Pyrates broke out from _Cicilia_, a Country of _Asia Minor_,\\nsituate on the Coast of the _Mediterranean_, betwixt _Syria_ on the East,\\nfrom whence it is divided by Mount _Tauris_, and _Armenia Minor_ on the\\nWest. This Beginning was mean and inconsiderable, having but two or three\\nShips, and a few Men, with which they cruised about the _Greek_ Islands,\\ntaking such Ships as were very ill arm'd or weakly defended; however, by\\nthe taking of many Prizes, they soon increased in Wealth and Power: The\\nfirst Action of their's which made a Noise, was the taking of _Julius\\nCæsar_, who was as yet a Youth, and who being obliged to fly from the\\nCruelties of _Sylla_, who sought his Life, went into _Bithinia_, and\\nsojourned a while with _Nicomedes_, King of that Country; in his Return\\nback by Sea, he was met with, and taken, by some of these Pyrates, near the\\nIsland of _Pharmacusa_: These Pyrates had a barbarous Custom of tying their\\nPrisoners Back to Back and throwing them into the Sea; but, supposing\\n_Cæsar_ to be some Person of a high Rank, because of his purple Robes, and\\nthe Number of his Attendants, they thought it would be more for their\\nProfit to preserve him, in hopes of receiving a great Sum for his Ransom;\\ntherefore they told him he should have his Liberty, provided he would pay\\nthem twenty Talents, which they judg'd to be a very high Demand, in our\\nMoney, about three thousand six hundred Pounds Sterling; he smiled, and of\\nhis own Accord promised them fifty Talents; they were both pleased, and\\nsurpriz'd at his Answer, and consented that several of his Attendants\\nshould go by his Direction and raise the Money; and he was left among these\\nRuffians with no more than 3 Attendants. He pass'd eight and thirty Days,\\nand seemed so little concerned or afraid, that often when he went to sleep,\\nhe used to charge them not to make a Noise, threatening, if they disturbed\\nhim, to hang them all; he also play'd at Dice with them, and sometimes\\nwrote Verses and Dialogues, which he used to repeat, and also cause them to\\nrepeat, and if they did not praise and admire them, he would call them\\nBeasts and Barbarians, telling them he would crucify them. They took all\\nthese as the Sallies of a juvenile Humour, and were rather diverted, than\\ndispleased at them.\\n\\nAt length his Attendants return'd with his Ransom, which he paid, and was\\ndischarged; he sail'd for the Port of _Miletum_, where, as soon as he was\\narriv'd, he used all his Art and Industry in fitting out a Squadron of\\nShips, which he equipp'd and arm'd at his own Charges; and sailing in Quest\\nof the Pyrates, he surpriz'd them as they lay at Anchor among the Islands,\\nand took those who had taken him before, with some others; the Money he\\nfound upon them he made Prize of, to reimburse his Charges, and he carry'd\\nthe Men to _Pergamus_ or _Troy_, and there secured them in Prison: In the\\nmean Time, he apply'd himself to _Junius_, then Governor of _Asia_, to whom\\nit belonged to judge and determine of the Punishment of these Men; but\\n_Junius_ finding there was no Money to be had, answered _Cæsar_, that he\\nwould think at his Leisure, what was to be done with those Prisoners;\\n_Cæsar_ took his Leave of him, returned back to _Pergamus_, and commanded\\nthat the Prisoners should be brought out and executed, according to Law in\\nthat Case provided; which is taken Notice of, in a Chapter at the End of\\nthis Book, concerning the Laws in Cases of Pyracy: And thus he gave them\\nthat Punishment in Earnest, which he had often threatned them with in Jest.\\n\\n_Cæsar_ went strait to Rome, where, being engaged in the Designs of his own\\nprivate Ambition, as were almost all the leading Men in Rome, the Pyrates\\nwho were left, had Time to increase to a prodigious Strength; for while the\\ncivil Wars lasted, the Seas were left unguarded, so that _Plutarch_ tells\\nus, that they erected diverse Arsenals full of all manner of warlike\\nStores, made commodious Harbours, set up Watch-Towers and Beacons all along\\nthe Coasts of _Cilicia_; that they had a mighty Fleet, well equipp'd and\\nfurnish'd, with Galliots of Oars, mann'd, not only with Men of desperate\\nCourage, but also with expert Pilots and Mariners; they had their Ships of\\nForce, and light Pinnaces for cruising and making Discoveries, in all no\\nless than a thousand Sail; so gloriously set out, that they were as much to\\nbe envied for their gallant Shew, as fear'd for their Force; having the\\nStern and Quarters all gilded with Gold and their Oars plated with Silver,\\nas well as purple Sails; as if their greatest Delight had been to glory in\\ntheir Iniquity. Nor were they content with committing Pyracies and\\nInsolencies by Sea, they committed as great Depredations by Land, or rather\\nmade Conquests; for they took and sack'd no less than four hundred Cities,\\nlaid several others under Contributions, plundered the Temples of the Gods,\\nand inriched themselves with the Offerings deposited in them; they often\\nlanded Bodies of Men, who not only plundered the Villages along the Sea\\nCoast, but ransacked the fine Houses of the Noblemen along the Tiber. A\\nBody of them once took _Sextillius_ and _Bellinus_, two _Roman_ Prætors, in\\ntheir purple Robes, going from Rome to their Governments, and carried them\\naway with all their Sergeants, Officers and Vergers; they also took the\\nDaughter of _Antonius_ a consular Person, and one who had obtained the\\nHonour of a Triumph, as she was going to the Country House of her Father.\\n\\nBut what was most barbarous, was a Custom they had when they took any Ship,\\nof enquiring of the Person on Board, concerning their Names and Country; if\\nany of them said he was a _Roman_, they fell down upon their Knees, as if\\nin a Fright at the Greatness of that Name, and begg'd Pardon for what they\\nhad done, and imploring his Mercy, they used to perform the Offices of\\nServants about his Person, and when they found they had deceived him into a\\nBelief of their being sincere, they hung out the Ladder of the Ship, and\\ncoming with a shew of Courtesy, told him, he had his Liberty, desiring him\\nto walk out of the Ship, and this in the Middle of the Sea, and when they\\nobserved him in Surprize, as was natural, they used to throw him overboard\\nwith mighty shouts of Laughter; so wanton they were in their Cruelty.\\n\\nThus, while _Rome_ was Mistress oft he World, she suffered Insults and\\nAffronts, almost at her Gates, from these powerful Robbers; but what for a\\nwhile made Faction cease, and roused the Genius of that People, never used\\nto suffer Wrongs from a fair Enemy, was an excessive Scarcity of Provisions\\nin _Rome_, occasioned by all the Ships loaden with Corn and Provisions from\\n_Sicily_, _Corsica_, and other Places, being intercepted and taken by these\\nPyrates, insomuch that they were almost reduced to a Famine: Upon this,\\n_Pompey_ the _Great_ was immediately appointed General to manage this War;\\nfive hundered Ships were immediately fitted out, he had fourteen Senators,\\nMen of Experience in the War, for his Vice-Admirals; and so considerable an\\nEnemy, were these Ruffians become, that no less than an Army of a hundred\\nthousand Foot, and five thousand Horse was appointed to invade them by\\nLand; but it happened very luckily for _Rome_, that _Pompey_ sail'd out\\nbefore the Pyrate had Intelligence of a Design against them, so that their\\nShips were scattered all over the _Mediterranean_, like Bees gone out from\\na Hive, some one Way, some another, to bring Home their Lading; _Pompey_\\ndivided his Fleet into thirteen Squadrons, to whom he appointed their\\nseveral Stations, so that great Numbers of the Pyrates fell into their\\nHands, Ship by Ship, without any Loss; forty Days he passed in scouring the\\n_Mediterranean_, some of the Fleet cruizing along the Coast of _Africk_,\\nsome about the Islands, and some upon the Italian Coasts, so that often\\nthose Pyrates who were flying from one Squadron, fell in with another;\\nhowever, some of them escaped, and these making directly to _Cilicia_, and\\nacquainting their Confederates on Shore with what had happened, they\\nappointed a Rendezvous of all the Ships that had escaped at the Port of\\n_Coracesium_, in the same Country. _Pompey_ finding the _Mediterranean_\\nquite clear, appointed a Meeting of all his Fleet at the Haven of\\n_Brundusium_, and from thence sailing round into the _Adriatick_, he went\\ndirectly to attack these Pyrates in their Hives; as soon as he came near\\nthe _Coracesium_ in _Cilicia_, where the Remainder of the Pyrates now lay,\\nthey had the Hardiness to come and give him Battle, but the Genius of old\\n_Rome_ prevailed, and the Pyrates received an entire Overthrow, being all\\neither taken or destroyed; but as they made many strong Fortresses upon the\\nSea Coast, and built Castles and strong Holds up the Country, about the\\nFoot of Mount _Taurus_, he was obliged to besiege them with his Army; some\\nPlaces he took by Storm, others surrendered to his Mercy, to whom he gave\\ntheir Lives, and at length he made an entire Conquest.\\n\\nBut it is probable, that had these Pyrates receiv'd sufficient Notice of\\nthe _Roman_ Preparation against them, so as they might have had Time to\\ndraw their scattered Strength into a Body, to have met _Pompey_ by Sea, the\\nAdvantage appeared greatly on their Side, in Numbers of Shipping, and of\\nMen; nor did they want Courage, as may be seen by their coming out of the\\nPort of _Coracesium_, to give the _Romans_ Battle, with a Force much\\ninferior to their's; I say, had they overthrown _Pompey_, it is likely they\\nwould have made greater Attempts, and _Rome_, which had conquer'd the whole\\nWorld, might have been subdued by a Parcel of Pyrates.\\n\\nThis is a Proof how dangerous it is to Governments to be negligent, and not\\ntake an early Care in suppressing these Sea Banditti, before they gather\\nStrength.\\n\\nThe Truth of this Maxim may be better exemplified in the History of\\n_Barbarouse_, a Native in the City of _Mitylene_, in the Island of\\n_Lesbos_, in the _Egean_ Sea; a Fellow of ordinary Birth, who being bred to\\nthe Sea, first set out from thence upon the pyrating Account with only one\\nsmall Vessel, but by the Prizes he took, he gain'd immense Riches, so that\\ngetting a great Number of large Ships, all the bold and dissolute Fellows\\nof those Islands flock'd to him, and listed in his Service, for the Hopes\\nof Booty; so that his Strength was increased to a formidable Fleet: With\\nthese he perform'd such bold and adventurous Actions, that he became the\\nTerror of the Seas. About this Time it happened that _Selim Eutemi_, King\\nof _Algiers_, having refused to pay the accustomed Tribute to the\\n_Spaniards_, was apprehensive of an Invasion from thence; wherefore he\\ntreated with _Barbarouse_, upon the Foot of an Ally, to come and assist\\nhim, and deliver him from paying this Tribute; _Barbarouse_ readily came\\ninto it, and sailing to _Algiers_ with a great Fleet, he put part of his\\nMen on Shore, and having laid a Plot to surprize the City, he effected it\\nwith great Success, and murder'd _Selim_ in a Bath; soon after which, he\\nwas himself crowned King of _Algiers_; after this he made War upon\\n_Abdilabde_, King of _Tunis_, and overthrew him in Battle; he extended his\\nConquests on all Sides; and thus from a Thief became a mighty King: and\\ntho' he was at last kill'd in Battle, yet he had so well established\\nhimself upon that Throne, that, dying without Issue, he left the\\nInheritance of the Kingdom to his Brother, another Pyrate.\\n\\n                                * * *\\n\\nI come now to speak of the Pyrates infesting the _West-Indies_, where they\\nare more numerous than in any other Parts of the World, on several Reasons:\\n\\n_First_, Because there are so many uninhabited little Islands and Keys,\\nwith Harbours convenient and secure for cleaning their Vessels, and\\nabounding with what they often want, Provision; I mean Water, Sea-Fowl,\\nTurtle, Shell, and other Fish; where, if they carry in but strong Liquor,\\nthey indulge a Time, and become ready for new Expeditions before any\\nIntelligence can reach to hurt them.\\n\\nIt may here perhaps be no unnecessary Digression, to explain upon what they\\ncall Keys in the _West-Indies_: These are small sandy Islands, appearing a\\nlittle above the Surf of the Water, with only a few Bushes or Weeds upon\\nthem, but abound (those most at any Distance from the Main) with Turtle,\\namphibious Animals, that always chuse the quietest and most unfrequented\\nPlace, for laying their Eggs, which are to a vast Number in the Seasons,\\nand would seldom be seen, but for this, (except by Pyrates:) Then Vessels\\nfrom _Jamaica_ and the other Governments make Voyages, called Turtling, for\\nsupplying the People, a common and approved Food with them. I am apt to\\nthink these _Keys_, especially those nigh Islands, to have been once\\ncontiguous with them, and separated by Earthquakes (frequently there) or\\nInundations, because some of them that have been within continual View, as\\nthose nigh _Jamaica_, are observed within our Time, to be entirely wasted\\naway and lost, and others daily wasting. There are not only of the Use\\nabove taken Notice of to Pyrates; but it is commonly believed were always\\nin buccaneering pyratical Times, the hiding Places for their Riches, and\\noften Times a Shelter for themselves, till their Friends on the Main, had\\nfound Means to obtain Indemnity for their Crimes; for you must understand,\\nwhen Acts of Grace were more frequent, and the Laws less severe, these Men\\ncontinually found Favours and Incouragers at _Jamaica_, and perhaps they\\nare not all dead yet; I have been told many of them them still living have\\nbeen of the same Trade, and left it off only because they can live as well\\nhonestly, and gain now at the hazard of others Necks.\\n\\nSecondly, another Reason why these Seas are chose by Pyrates, is the great\\nCommerce thither by _French_, _Spaniards_, _Dutch_, and especially\\n_English_ Ships: They are sure in the Latitude of these trading Islands, to\\nmeet with Prizes, Booties of Provision, Cloathing, and Naval-Stores, and\\nsometimes Money; there being great Sums remitted this Way to _England_;\\n(the Returns of the Affiento, and private Slave-Trade, to the _Spanish\\nWest-Indies_:) And in short, by some one or other, all the Riches of\\n_Potosi_.\\n\\nA third Reason, is the Inconveniency and Difficulty of being pursued by the\\nMen of War, the many small Inlets, Lagoons and Harbours, on these solitary\\nIslands and Keys, is a natural Security.\\n\\n'Tis generally here that the Pyrates begin their Enterprizes, setting out\\nat first with a very small Force; and by infesting these Seas, and those of\\nthe Continent of _North-America_, in a Year's Time, if they have good luck\\non their Sides, they accumulate such Strength, as enables them to make\\nforeign Expeditions: The first, is usually to _Guiney_, taking the _Azores_\\nand _Cape de Verd_ Islands in their Way, and then to _Brazil_ and the\\n_East-Indies_, where if they meet with prosperous Voyages, they set down at\\n_Madagascar_, or the neighbouring Islands, and enjoy their ill gotten\\nWealth, among their elder Brethren, with Impunity. But that I may not give\\ntoo much Encouragement to the Profession, I must inform my maritime\\nReaders, that the far greater Part of these Rovers are cut short in the\\nPursuit, by a sudden Precipitation into the other World.\\n\\nThe Rise of these Rovers, since the Peace of _Utrecht_, or at least, the\\ngreat Encrease of them, may justly be computed to the _Spanish_ Settlements\\nin the _West Indies_; the Governors of which, being often some hungry\\nCourtiers, sent thither to repair or make a Fortune, generally Countenance\\nall Proceedings that bring in Profit: They grant Commissions to great\\nNumbers of Vessels of War, on Pretence of preventing an interloping Trade,\\nwith Orders to seize all Ships or Vessels whatsoever, within five Leagues\\nof their Coasts, which our _English_ Ships cannot well avoid coming, in\\ntheir Voyage to _Jamaica_. But if the _Spanish_ Captains chance to exceed\\nthis Commission, and rob and plunder at Discretion, the Sufferers are\\nallowed to complain, and exhibit a Process in their Court, and after great\\nExpence of Suit, Delay of Time, and other Inconveniencies, obtain a Decree\\nin their Favour, but then when the Ship and Cargo comes to be claim'd, with\\nCosts of Suit, they find, to their Sorrow, that it has been previously\\ncondemn'd, and the Plunder divided among the Crew; the Commander that made\\nthe Capture, who alone is responsible, is found to be a poor raskally\\nFellow, not worth a Groat, and, no doubt, is plac'd in that Station for the\\nlike Purposes.\\n\\nThe frequent Losses sustain'd by our Merchants abroad, by these Pyrates,\\nwas Provocation enough to attempt something by way of Reprisal; and a fair\\nOpportunity offering it self in the Year 1716, the Traders of the\\n_West-Indies_, took Care not to slip it over, but made the best Use of it\\ntheir Circumstances would permit.\\n\\nIt was about two Years before, that the _Spanish_ Galleons, or Plate Fleet,\\nhad been cast away in the Gulf or _Florida_; and several Vessels from the\\n_Havana_, were at work, with diving Engines, to fish up the Silver that was\\non board the Galleons.\\n\\nThe _Spaniards_ had recovered some Millions of Pieces of Eight, and had\\ncarried it all to the _Havana_; but they had at present about 350000 Pieces\\nof Eight in Silver, then upon the Spot, and were daily taking up more. In\\nthe mean time, two Ships, and three Sloops, fitted out from _Jamaica_,\\n_Barbadoes_, _&c._ under Captain _Henry Jennings_, sail'd to the Gulf, and\\nfound the _Spaniards_ there upon the Wreck; the Money before spoken of, was\\nleft on Shore, deposited in a Store-House, under the Government of two\\nCommissaries, and a Guard of about 60 Soldiers.\\n\\nThe Rovers came directly upon the Place, bringing their little Fleet to an\\nAnchor, and, in a Word, landing 300 Men, they attack'd the Guard, who\\nimmediately ran away; and thus they seized the Treasure, which they carried\\noff, making the best of their Way to _Jamaica_.\\n\\nIn their Way they unhappily met with a _Spanish_ Ship, bound from _Porto\\nBello_ to the _Havana_, with a great many rich Goods, _viz._ Bales of\\nCochineal, Casks of Indico, and 60000 Pieces of Eight more, which their\\nHands being in, they took, and having rifled the Vessel, let her go.\\n\\nThey went away to _Jamaica_ with their Booty, and were followed in View of\\nthe Port, by the _Spaniards_, who having seen them thither, went back to\\nthe Governor of the _Havana_, with the Account of it, who immediately sent\\na Vessel to the Governor of _Jamaica_ to complain of this Robbery, and to\\nreclaim the Goods.\\n\\nAs it was in full Peace, and contrary to all Justice and Right, that this\\nFact was committed, they were soon made sensible that the Government at\\n_Jamaica_ would not suffer them to go unpunished, much less protect them.\\nTherefore they saw a Necessity of shifting for themselves; so, to make bad\\nworse, they went to Sea again, tho' not without disposing of their Cargo to\\ngood Advantage, and furnishing themselves with Ammunition, Provisions,\\n_&c._ and being thus made desperate, they turn'd Pyrates, robbing not the\\n_Spaniards_ only, but their own Countrymen, and any Nation they could lay\\ntheir Hands on.\\n\\nIt happened about this Time, that the _Spaniards_, with three or four small\\nMen of War, fell upon our Logwood Cutters, in the Bay of _Campeachy_, and\\nBay or _Honduras_; and after they had made Prizes of the following Ships\\nand Vessels, they gave the Men belonging to them, three Sloops to carry\\nthem home, but these Men being made desperate by their Misfortunes, and\\nmeeting with the Pyrates, they took on with them, and so encreas'd their\\nNumber.\\n\\n_The LIST of Ships and Vessels taken by the_ Spanish _Men of War in\\nthe Year_ 1716.\\n\\nThe _Stafford_, Captain _Knocks_, from _New-England_, bound for _London_.\\n   _Anne_, ------ _Gernish_, for ditto.\\n   _Dove_, ------ _Grimstone_, for _New-England_.\\nA Sloop, ------ _Alden_, for ditto.\\nA Brigantine, ------ _Mosson_, for ditto.\\nA Brigantine, ------ _Turfield_, for ditto.\\nA Brigantine, ------ _Tennis_, for ditto.\\nA Ship, ------ ------ _Porter_, for ditto.\\n   _Indian Emperor_, _Wentworth_, for _New-England_.\\nA Ship, ------ _Rich_, Master.\\n   Ditto, ------ _Bay_.\\n   Ditto, ------ _Smith_.\\n   Ditto, ------ _Stockum_.\\n   Ditto, ------ _Satlely_.\\nA Sloop, ------ ------ _Richards_, belonging to _New-England_.\\nTwo Sloops, ------ ------ belonging to _Jamaica_.\\nOne Sloop ------ ------ of _Barbadoes_.\\nTwo Ships ------ ------ from _Scotland_.\\nTwo Ships ------ ------ from _Holland_.\\n\\nThe Rovers being now pretty strong, they consulted together about getting\\nsome Place of Retreat, where they might lodge their Wealth, clean and\\nrepair their Ships, and make themselves a kind of Abode. They were not long\\nin resolving, but fixed upon the Island of _Providence_, the most\\nconsiderable of the _Bahama_ Islands, lying in the Latitude of about 24\\nDegrees North, and to the Eastward of the _Spanish Florida_.\\n\\nThis Island is about 28 Miles long, and eleven where broadest, and has a\\nHarbour big enough to hold 500 Sail of Ships; before which lies a small\\nIsland, which makes two Inlets to the Harbour; at either Way there is a\\nBar, over which no Ship of 500 Tun can pass. The _Bahama_ Islands were\\npossess'd by the _English_ till the Year 1700, when the _French_ and\\n_Spaniards_ from _Petit Guavus_, invaded them, took the Fort and Governor\\nin the Island of _Providence_, plunder'd and destroy'd the Settlements,\\n_&c._ carried off half the Blacks, and the rest of the People, who fled to\\nthe Woods, retired afterwards to _Carolina_.\\n\\nIn March 1705-6, the House of Lords did in an Address to her late Majesty,\\nset forth,\\n\\n   `That the\\n   _French_ and _Spaniards_ had twice, during the Time\\n   of the War, over run and plundered the _Bahama_\\n   Islands, that there was no Form of Government\\n   there: That the Harbour of the Isle of _Providence_,\\n   might be easily put in a Posture of Defence, and\\n   that it would be of dangerous Consequence, should\\n   those Islands fall into the Hands of the Enemy;\\n   wherefore the Lords humbly besought her Majesty\\n   to use such Methods as she should think\\n   proper for taking the said Island into her Hands,\\n   in order to secure the same to the Crown of this\\n   Kingdom, and to the Security and Advantage\\n   of the Trade thereof.\\n\\nBut, however it happened, no Means were used in compliance to that Address,\\nfor securing the _Bahama_ Islands, till the _English_ Pyrates had made\\n_Providence_ their Retreat and general Receptacle; then 'twas found\\nabsolutely necessary, in order to dislodge that troublesome Colony; and\\nInformation being made by the Merchants to the Government, of the Mischief\\nthey did, and were likely to do, his Majesty was pleased to grant the\\nfollowing Order.\\n\\n_Whitehall September_ 15, 1716.\\n\\n   `COmplaint having been made to his Majesty,\\n   by great Number of Merchants, Masters of\\n   Ships and others, as well as by several Governors\\n   of his Majesty's Islands and Plantations in the\\n   _West-Indies_; that the Pyrates are grown so numerous,\\n   that they infest not only the Seas near _Jamaica_,\\n   but even those of the Northern Continent\\n   of _America_; and that, unless some effectual Means\\n   be used, the whole Trade from _Great Britain_ to\\n   those Parts, will not be only obstructed, but in\\n   imminent Danger of being lost: His Majesty has,\\n   upon mature Deliberation in Council, been pleased,\\n   in the first Place, to order a proper Force\\n   to be employ'd for the suppressing the said Pyrates,\\n   which Force so to be employed, is as\\n   follows.\\n\\n`A List of his Majesty's Ships and Vessels employed, and to be\\nemployed, at the British Governments and Plantations in the _West-Indies_.\\n\\nPlace where.

This Gentleman received a Commission from his Majesty, to be\\nGovernor of the Island of _Providence_, and was vested with Power to make\\nUse of all possible Methods for reducing the Pyrates; and that nothing\\nmight be wanting, he carried with him, the King's Proclamation of Pardon,\\nto those who should return to their Duty by a certain Time; the\\nProclamation is as follows;\\n\\nBy the KING,\\n\\nA PROCLAMATION, for suppressing of PYRATES.\\n\\n      GEORGE R.\\n\\nW_Hereas we have received Information, that several Persons, Subjects\\nof _Great Britain_, have since the _24_th Day of _June_, in the Year of our\\nLord _1715_, committed divers Pyracies and Robberies upon the High-Seas, in\\nthe _West-Indies_, or adjoyning to our Plantations, which hath and may\\nOccasion great Damage to the Merchants of _Great Britain_, and others\\ntrading into those Parts; and tho' we have appointed such a Force as we\\njudge sufficient for suppressing the said Pyrates, yet the more effectually\\nto put an End to the same, we have thought fit, by and with the Advice of\\nour Privy Council, to Issue this our Royal Proclamation; and we do hereby\\npromise, and declare, that in Case any of the said Pyrates, shall on or\\nbefore the _5_th of _September_, in the Year of our Lord _1718_, surrender\\nhim or themselves, to one of our Principal Secretaries of State in _Great\\nBritain_ or _Ireland_, or to any Governor or Deputy Governor of any of our\\nPlantations beyond the Seas; every such Pyrate and Pyrates so surrendering\\nhim, or themselves, as aforesaid, shall have our gracious Pardon, of and\\nfor such, his or their Pyracy, or Pyracies, by him or them committed before\\nthe fifth of _January_ next ensuing. And we do hereby strictly charge and\\ncommand all our Admirals, Captains, and other Officers at Sea, and all our\\nGovernors and Commanders of any Forts, Castles, or other Places in our\\nPlantations, and all other our Officers Civil and Military, to seize and\\ntake such of the Pyrates, who shall refuse or neglect to surrender\\nthemselves accordingly. And we do hereby further declare, that in Case any\\nPerson or Persons, on, or after, the _6_th Day of _September 1718_, shall\\ndiscover or seize, or cause or procure to be discovered or seized, any one\\nor more of the said Pyrates, so refusing or neglecting to surrender\\nthemselves as aforesaid, so as they may be brought to Justice, and\\nconvicted of the said Offence, such Person or Persons, so making such\\nDiscovery or Seizure, or causing or procuring such Discovery or Seizure to\\nbe made, shall have and receive as a Reward for the same, _viz._ for every\\nCommander of any private Ship or Vessel, the Sum of _100_ l. for every\\nLieutenant, Master, Boatswain, Carpenter, and Gunner, the Sum of _40_ l;\\nfor every inferior Officer, the Sum of _30_ l. and for every private Man,\\nthe Sum of _20_ l. And if any Person or Persons, belonging to and being\\nPart of the Crew of any such Pyrate Ship or Vessel, shall on or after the\\nsaid sixth Day of _September 1718_, seize and deliver, or cause to be\\nseized or delivered, any Commander or Commanders, of such Pyrate Ship or\\nVessel, so as that he or they be brought to Justice, and convicted of the\\nsaid Offence, such Person or Persons, as a Reward for the same, shall\\nreceive for every such Commander, the Sum of _200_ l. which said Sums, the\\nLord Treasurer, or the Commissioners of our Treasury for the Time being,\\nare hereby required, and desired to pay accordingly._\\n\\nGiven at our Court, at _Hampton-Court_, the fifth Day of\\n_September_, 1717, in the fourth Year of our Regin.\\n\\nGod save the KING.\\n\\nBefore Governor _Rogers_ went over, the Proclamation was sent to them,\\nwhich they took as _Teague_ took the Covenant, that is, they made Prize of\\nthe Ship and Proclamation too; however, they sent for those who were out a\\nCruising, and called a general Council, but there was so much Noise and\\nGlamour, that nothing could be agreed on; some were for fortifying the\\nIsland, to stand upon their own Terms, and Treating with the Government\\nupon the Foot of a Commonwealth; others were also for strengthening the\\nIsland for their own Security, but were not strenuous for these\\nPunctillios, so that they might have a general Pardon, without being\\nobliged to make any Restitution, and to retire, with all their Effects, to\\nthe neighbouring _British_ Plantations.\\n\\nBut Captain _Jennings_, who was their Commadore, and who always bore a\\ngreat Sway among them, being a Man of good Understanding, and good Estate,\\nbefore this Whim took him of going a Pyrating, resolved upon surrendering,\\nwithout more ado, to the Terms of the Proclamation, which so disconcerted\\nall their Measures, that the _Congress_ broke up very abruptly without\\ndoing any Thing; and presently _Jennings_, and by his Example, about 150\\nmore, came in to the Governor of _Bermudas_, and had their Certificates,\\ntho' the greatest Part of them returned again, like the Dog to the Vomit.\\nThe Commanders who were then in the Island, besides Captain _Jennings_\\nabovementioned, I think were these, _Benjamin Hornigold, Edward Teach, John\\nMartel, James Fife, Christopher Winter, Nicholas Brown, Paul Williams,\\nCharles Bellamy, Oliver la Bouche, _Major_ Penner, Ed. England, T. Burgess,\\nTho. Cocklyn, R. Sample, Charles Vane_, and two or three others:\\n_Hornigold, Williams, Burgess _and_ la Bouche_ were afterwards cast away;\\n_Teach_ and _Penner_ killed, and their Crews taken; _James Fife_ killed by\\nhis own Men; _Martel_'s Crew destroyed, and he forced on an uninhabited\\nIsland; _Cocklyn, Sample_ and _Vane_ hanged; _Winter_ and _Brown_\\nsurrendered to the _Spaniards_ at _Cuba_, and _England_ lives now at\\n_Madagascar_.\\n\\nIn the Month of _May_ or _June_ 1718, Captain _Rogers_ arrived at his\\nGovernment, with two of his Majesty's Ships, and found several of the\\nabovesaid Pyrates there, who upon the coming of the Men of War, all\\nsurrendered to the Pardon, except _Charles Vane_ and his Crew, which\\nhappened after this Manner.\\n\\nI have before described the Harbour to have two Inlets, by Means of a small\\nIsland lying at the Mouth of it; at one of which, both the Men of War\\nentered, and left the other open, so that _Vane_ slip'd his Cable, set Fire\\nto a large Prize they had there, and resolutely put out, firing at the Man\\nof War as he went off.\\n\\nAs soon as Captain _Rogers_ had settled himself in his Government, he built\\na Fort for his Defence, and garrisoned it with the People he found upon the\\nIsland; the _quondam_ Pyrates, to the Number of 400, he formed into\\nCompanies, appointed Officers of those whom he most confided in, and then\\nset about to settle a Trade with the _Spaniards_, in the Gulf of _Mexico_;\\nin one of which Voyages, Captain _Burgess_ abovementioned, died, and\\nCaptain _Hornigold_, another of the famous Pyrates, was cast away upon\\nRocks, a great Way from Land, and perished, but five of his Men got into a\\nCanoe and were saved.\\n\\nCaptain _Rogers_ sent out a Sloop to get Provisions, and gave the Command\\nto one _John Augur_, one of the Pyrates, who had accepted of the Act of\\nGrace; in their Voyage they met with two Sloops, and _John_ and his\\nComrades not yet forgetting their former Business, made Use of their old\\nFreedom, and took out of them in Money and Goods, to the Value of about 500\\n_l._ after this they steered away for _Hispaniola_, not being satisfy'd\\nwhether the Governor would admit them to carry on two Trades at once, and\\nso thought to have bidden Farewel to the _Bahama_ Islands; but as ill Luck\\nwould have it, they met with a violent Turnado, wherein they lost their\\nMast, and were drove back to one of the uninhabited _Bahama_'s, and lost\\ntheir Sloop; the Men got all ashore, and lived up and down in the Wood, for\\na little Time, till Governor _Rogers_ happening to hear of their\\nExpedition, and where they had got to, sent out an armed Sloop to the\\naforesaid Island; the Master of which, with good Words and fair Promises,\\ngot them on Board, and brought them all to _Providence_, being a eleven\\nPersons, ten of which were try'd at a Court of Admiralty, convicted, and\\nhanged by the other's Evidence, in the Sight of all their former Companions\\nand fellow Thieves. The Criminals would fain have spirited up the pardoned\\nPyrates, to rescue them out of the Hands of the Officers of Justice,\\ntelling them from the Gallows, that, _They never thought to have seen the\\nTime, when ten such Men as they should be ty'd up and hanged like Dogs, and\\nfour hundered of their sworn Friends and Companions quietly standing by to\\nbehold the Spectacle._ One _Hamphrey Morrice_ urged the Matter further than\\nthe rest, taxing them with Pusilanimity and Cowardice, as if it were a\\nBreach of Honour in them not to rise and save them from the ignominious\\nDeath they were going to suffer. But 'twas all in vain, they were now told,\\nit was their Business to turn their Minds to another World, and sincerely\\nto repent of what Wickedness they had done in this. _Yes_, answered one of\\nthem, _I do heartily repent; I repent I had not done more Mischief, and\\nthat we did not cut the Throats of them that took us, and I am extremely\\nsorry that you an't all hang'd as well as we. So do I_, says another: _And\\nI_, says a third; and then they were all turned off, without making any\\nother dying Speeches, except one _Dennis Macarty_, who told the People,\\n_That some Friends of his had often said he should die in his Shoes, but\\nthat he would make them Lyars_, and so kicked them off. And thus ended the\\nLives, with their Adventures, of those miserable Wretches, who may serve as\\nsad Examples of the little Effect Mercy has upon Men once abandoned to an\\nevil Course of Life.\\n\\nLeast I be thought severe in my Animadversions upon the _Spanish_\\nProceedings in the _West-Indies_, in respect to their Dealings with us; I\\nshall mention an Instance or two, wherein I'll be as concise as possible,\\nand then transcribe some original Letters from the Governor of _Jamaica_,\\nand an Officer of a Man of War, to the _Alcaldees_ of _Trinidado_, on the\\nIsland of _Cuba_, with their Answers, translated into _English_, and then\\nproceed to the particular Histories of the Pyrates and their Crews, that\\nhave made most Noise in the World in _our own Times_.\\n\\nAbout _March_ 1722, one of our Men of War trading upon the Coast, _viz._\\nthe _Greyhound_ Galley, Captain _Walron_, the said Captain invited some of\\nthe Merchants to Dinner, who with their Attendants and Friends came on\\nBoard to the Number of 16 or 18 in all; and having concerted Measures,\\nabout six or eight dined in the Cabin, and the rest were waiting on the\\nDeck. While the Captain and his Guests were at Dinner, the Boatswain Pipes\\nfor the Ship's Company to dine; accordingly the Men take their Platters,\\nreceive their Provisions, and down they go between Decks, leaving only 4 or\\n5 Hands besides the _Spaniards_, above, who were immediately dispatched by\\nthem, and the Hatches laid on the rest; those in the Cabin were as ready as\\ntheir Companions, for they pulled out their Pistols and shot the Captain,\\nSurgeon and another dead, and grievously wounded the Lieutenant; but he\\ngetting out of the Window upon a Side-Ladder, thereby saved his Life, and\\nso they made themselves Masters of the Ship in an Instant: But by\\naccidental good Fortune, she was recovered before she was carry'd off; for\\nCaptain _Walron_ having mann'd a Sloop with 30 Hands out of his Ship's\\nCompany, had sent her to Windward some Days before, also for Trade, which\\nthe _Spaniards_ knew very well; and just as the Action was over they saw\\nthis Sloop coming down, before the Wind, towards their Ship; upon which the\\n_Spaniards_ took about 10000 _l._ in Specie, as I am informed, quitted the\\nShip, and went off in their Launch unmolested.\\n\\nAbout the same Time, a _Guard le Coast_, of _Porto Rico_, commanded by one\\n_Matthew Luke_, an Italian, took four _English_ Vessels, and murthered all\\nthe Crews: He was taken by the _Lanceston_ Man of War, in _May_ 1722, and\\nbrought to _Jamaica_, were they were all but seven deservedly hanged. It is\\nlikely the Man of War might not have meddled with her, but that she blindly\\nlaid the _Lanceston_ on Board, thinking she had been a Merchant Ship, who\\nthereupon catched a Tartar. Afterwards in rummaging there was found a\\nCartridge of Powder made up with a Piece of an _English_ Journal,\\nbelonging, I believe, to the _Crean_ Snow; and upon Examination, at last,\\nit was discovered that they had taken this Vessel and murthered the Crew;\\nand one of the _Spaniards_, when he came to die, confessed that he had\\nkilled twenty _English_ Men with his own Hands.\\n\\nS. Jago de la Vega, Febr. 20. _A Letter from his Excellency Sir\\n_Nicolas Laws_, our Governor, to the Alcaldes of _Trinidado_ on _Cuba_,\\ndated the _26_th of _Jan. 1721-2.\\n\\n      Gentlemen,\\n\\n   `THE frequent Depredations, Robberies, and\\n   other Acts of Hostility, which have been\\n   committed on the King my Royal Master's Subjects,\\n   by a Parcel of Banditti, who pretend to\\n   have Commissions from you, and in Reality are\\n   sheltered under your Government, is the Occasion\\n   of my sending the Bearer Captain _Chamberlain_,\\n   Commander of his Majesty's Snow _Happy_,\\n   to demand Satisfaction of you for so many notorious\\n   Robberies which your People have lately\\n   committed on the King's Subjects of this Island;\\n   particularly by those Traytors, _Nicolas Brown_\\n   and _Christopher Winter_, to whom you have given\\n   Protection. Such Proceedings as these are not\\n   only a Breach of the Law of Nations, but must\\n   appear to the World of a very extraordinary\\n   Nature, when considered that the Subjects of a\\n   Prince in Amity and Friendship with another,\\n   should give Countenance and encourage such vile\\n   Practices. I confess I have had long Patience, and\\n   declined using any violent Measures to obtain\\n   Satisfaction, hoping the Cessation of Arms, so\\n   happily concluded upon between our respective\\n   Sovereigns, would have put an effectual Stop to\\n   those Disorders; but on the contrary, I now find\\n   the Port of _Trinidado_ a Receptacle to Villains\\n   of all Nations. I do therefore think fit to acquaint\\n   you, and assure you in the King my Master's\\n   Name, that if I do meet with any of your\\n   Rogues for the future upon the Coast of this\\n   Island, I will order them to be hanged directly\\n   without Mercy; and I expect and demand of\\n   you to make ample Restitution to Captain _Chamberlain_\\n   or all the Negroes which the said _Brown_\\n   and Winter have lately taken off from the North-Side\\n   of this Island, and also of such Sloops and\\n   other Effects as they have been taken and robbed\\n   of, since the Cessation of Arms, and that you\\n   will deliver up to the Bearer such _English_ Men\\n   as are now detained, or otherwise remain at _Trinidado_;\\n   and also expect you will hereafter forbear\\n   granting any Commissions, or suffer any such\\n   notorious Villains to be equipp'd and fitted out\\n   from your Port: otherwise you may depend upon\\n   it, those that I can meet with, shall be esteemed\\n   Pyrates, and treated as such; of which I thought\\n   proper to give you Notice, and am, _&c._\\n\\n_A Letter from Mr. _Joseph Laws_, Lieutenant of his Majesty's Ship,\\n_Happy_ Snow, to the Alcaldes of _Trinidado_._\\n\\n      Genlemen,\\n\\n   `I Am sent by Commadore _Vernon_, Commander\\n   in Chief of all his Majesty's Ships in the\\n   _West-Indies_ to demand in the King our Master's\\n   Name, all the Vessels, with theirs Effects, _&c._\\n   and also the Negroes taken from _Jamaica_ since the\\n   Cessation of Arms; likewise all _Englishmen_ now\\n   detained, or otherwise remaining in your Port of\\n   _Trinidado_, particularly _Nicholas Brown_ and _Christopher\\n   Winter_, both of them being Traytors, Pyrates\\n   and common Enemies to all Nations: And\\n   the said Commadore hath ordered me to acquaint\\n   you, that he is surprized that the Subjects of a\\n   Prince in Amity and Friendship with another,\\n   should give Countenance to such notorious Villains.\\n   In Expectation of your immediate Compliance,\\n   I am, Gentlemen,\\n\\nOff the River _Trinidado_, _Feb._ 8. 1720.\\n\\nYour humble Servant, _Joseph Laws_.\\n\\n_The Answer of the Alcaldes of _Trinidado_, to Mr. _Laws_'s Letter._\\n\\n      Capt.

He served on Board the _Spanish_\\nFleet under Admiral _Cammock_, in the War in the _Mediterranean_; and after\\nthe Cessation of Arms with Spain, settled with several of his Countrymen\\n(_Irish_) in the _Spanish_ _West-Indies_. This _Guard del Coast_ made Prize\\nof Captain _Jones_'s Ship, and kept Possession of her from 5th to the 8th,\\nduring which Time she took also the _Prudent Hannah_ of _Boston_, _Thomas\\nMousell_ Master, and the _Dolphin_ of _Topsham_, _Theodore Bare_ Master,\\nboth laden and bound for _Virginia_: The former they sent away together\\nwith three Men and the Mate, under the Command of a _Spanish_ Officer and\\nCrew, the same Day she was taken; the latter they carried off with them,\\nputting the Master and all the Crew aboard Captain _Jones_'s Ship. They\\nplundered Captain _Jones_ of thirty six Men Slaves, some Gold-Dust, all his\\nCloaths, four great Guns and small Arms, and about four hundred Gallons of\\nRum, besides his Provisions and Stores, computed in all to 1500 _l._\\nSterling.\\n\\nCHAP. I. OF Captain _AVERY_, And his CREW.\\n\\nNONE of these bold Adventurers were ever so much talked of, for a\\nwhile, as _Avery_; he made as great a Noise in the World as _Meriveis_ does\\nnow, and was looked upon to be a Person of as great Consequence; he was\\nrepresented in _Europe_, as one that had raised himself to the Dignity of a\\nKing, and was likely to be the Founder of a new Monarchy; having, as it was\\nsaid, taken immense Riches, and married the Great _Mogul_'s Daughter, who\\nwas taken in an _Indian_ Ship, which fell into his Hands; and that he had\\nby her many Children, living in great Royalty and State; that he had built\\nForts, erected Magazines, and was Master of a stout Squadron of Ships,\\nmann'd with able and desperate Fellows of all Nations; that he gave\\nCommissions out in his own Name to the Captains of his Ships, and to the\\nCommanders of his Forts, and was acknowledged by them as their Prince. A\\nPlay was writ upon him, called, the _Successful Pyrate_; and, these\\nAccounts obtained such Belief, that several Schemes were offered to the\\nCouncil for fitting out a Squadron to take him; while others were for\\noffering him and his Companions an Act of Grace, and inviting them to\\n_England_, with all their Treasure, least his growing Greatness might\\nhinder the Trade of _Europe_ to the _East-Indies_.\\n\\nYet all these were no more than false Rumours, improved by the Credulity of\\nsome, and the Humour of others who love to tell strange Things; for, while\\nit was said, he was aspiring at a Crown, he wanted a Shilling; and at the\\nsame Time it was given out he was in Possession of such prodigious Wealth\\nin _Madagascar_, he was starving in _England_.\\n\\nNo doubt, but the Reader will have a Curiosity of knowing what became of\\nthis Man, and what were the true Grounds of so many false Reports\\nconcerning him; there fore, I shall, in as brief a Manner as I can, give\\nhis History.\\n\\nHe was born in the West of _England_ near _Plymouth_ in _Devonshire_, being\\nbred to the Sea, he served as a Mate of a Merchant-Man, in several trading\\nVoyages: It happened before the Peace of _Ryfwick_, when there was an\\nAlliance betwixt _Spain_, _England_, _Holland_, _&c._ against _France_,\\nthat the _French_ in _Martinico_, carried on a smugling Trade with the\\n_Spaniards_ on the Continent of _Peru_, which by the Laws of _Spain_, is\\nnot allowed to Friends in Time of Peace, for none but native _Spaniards_\\nare permitted to Traffick in those Parts, or set their Feet on Shore,\\nunless at any Time they are brought as Prisoners; wherefore they constantly\\nkeep certain Ships cruising along the Coast, whom they call _Guarda del\\nCosta_, who have the Orders to make Prizes of all ships they can light of\\nwithin five Leagues of Land. Now the _French_ growing very bold in Trade,\\nand the _Spaniards_ being poorly provided with Ships, and those they had\\nbeing of no Force, it often fell out, that when they light of the _French_\\nSmuglers, they were not strong enough to attack them, therefore it was\\nresolv'd in _Spain_, to hire two or three stout foreign Ships for their\\nService, which being known at _Bristol_, some Merchants of that City,\\nfitted out two Ships of thirty odd Guns, and 120 Hands each, well furnished\\nwith Provision and Ammunition, and all other Stores; and the Hire being\\nagreed for, by some Agents for _Spain_, they were commanded to sail for\\n_Corunna_ or the _Groine_, there to receive their Orders, and to take on\\nBoard some _Spanish_ Gentlemen, who were to go Passengers to _New-Spain_.\\n\\nOf one of these Ships, which I take to be call'd the _Duke_, Capt. _Gibson_\\nCommander, _Avery_ was first Mate, and being a Fellow of more Cunning than\\nCourage, he insinuated himself into the good Will of several of the boldest\\nFellows on Board the other Ship, as well as that which he was on Board of;\\nhaving sounded their Inclinations before he opened himself, and finding\\nthem ripe for his Design, he, at length, proposed to them, to run away with\\nthe Ship, telling them what great Wealth was to be had upon the Coasts of\\n_India_. It was no sooner said than agreed to, and they resolved to execute\\ntheir Plot at Ten a Clock the Night following.\\n\\nIt must be observ'd, the Captain was one of those who are mightily addicted\\nto Punch, so that he passed most of his Time on Shore, in some little\\ndrinking Ordinary; but this Day he did not go on Shore as usual; however,\\nthis did not spoil the Design, for he took his usual Dose on Board, and so\\ngot to Bed before the Hour appointed for the Business: The Men also who\\nwere not privy to the Design, turn'd into their Hammocks, leaving none upon\\nDeck but the Conspirators, who, indeed, were the greatest Part of the\\nShip's Crew. At the Time agreed on, the _Dutchess_'s Long-Boat appear'd,\\nwhich _Avery_ hailing in the usual Manner, was answered by the Men in her,\\n_Is your drunken Boatswain on Board?_ Which was the Watch-Word agreed\\nbetween them, and _Avery_ replying in the Affirmative, the Boat came aboard\\nwith sixteen stout Fellows, and joined the Company.\\n\\nWhen our Gentry saw that all was clear, they secured the Hatches, so went\\nto work; they did not slip the Anchor, but weigh'd it leisurely, and so put\\nto Sea without any Disorder or Confusion, tho' there were several Ships\\nthen lying in the Bay, and among them a _Dutch_ Frigate of forty Guns, the\\nCaptain of which was offered a great Reward to go out after her; but\\n_Mynheer_, who perhaps would not have been willing to have been served so\\nhimself could not be prevail'd upon to give such Usage to another, and so\\nlet Mr. _Avery_ pursue his Voyage, whither he had a Mind to.\\n\\nThe Captain, who by this Time, was awaked, either by the Motion of the\\nShip, or the Noise of working the Tackles, rung the Bell; _Avery_ and two\\nothers went into the Cabin; the Captain, half asleep, and in a kind of\\nFright, ask'd, _What was the Matter?_ _Avery_ answered cooly, _Nothing_;\\nthe Captain replied, _something's the Matter with the Ship, Does she drive?\\nWhat Weather is it?_ Thinking nothing less then that it had been a Storm,\\nand that the Ship was driven from her Anchors: _No, no_, answered _Avery_,\\n_we're at Sea, with a fair Wind and good Weather. At Sea! _says the\\nCaptain, _How can that be? Come_, says _Avery, don't be in a Fright, but\\nput on your Cloaths, and I'll let you into a Secret: -- You muse know, that\\nI am Captain of this Ship now, and this is my Cabin, therefore you must\\nwalk out; I am bound to _Madagascar_, with a Design of making my own\\nFortune, and that of all the brave Fellows joined with me._\\n\\nThe Captain having a little recovered his Senses, began to apprehend the\\nmeaning; however, his Fright was as great as before, which _Avery_\\nperceiving, bad him fear nothing, for, says he, if you have a Mind to make\\none of us, we will receive you, and if you'll turn sober, and mind your\\nBusiness, perhaps in Time I may make you one of my Lieutenants, if not,\\nhere's a Boat a-long-side, and you shall be set ashore.\\n\\nThe Captain was glad to hear this, and therefore accepted of his Offer, and\\nthe whole Crew being called up, to know who was willing to go on Shore with\\nthe Captain, and who to seek their Fortunes with the rest; there were not\\nabove five or six who were willing to quit this Enterprize; wherefore they\\nwere put into the Boat with the Captain that Minute, and made their Way to\\nthe Shore as well as they could.\\n\\nThey proceeded on their Voyage to _Madagascar_, but I do not find they took\\nany Ships in their Way; when they arrived at the N. E. Part of that Island,\\nthey found two Sloops at Anchor, who, upon seeing them, slip'd their Cables\\nand run themselves ashore, the Men all landing, and running into the Woods;\\nthese were two Sloops which the Men had run away with from the\\n_West-Indies_, and seeing _Avery_, they supposed him to be some Frigate\\nsent to take them, and therefore not being of Force to engage him, they did\\nwhat they could to save themselves.\\n\\nHe guessed where they were, and sent some of his Men on Shore to let them\\nknow they were Friends, and to offer they might join together for their\\ncommon Safety; the Sloops Men were well arm'd, and had posted themselves in\\na Wood, with Centinels just on the out-side, to observe whether the Ship\\nlanded her Men to pursue them, and they observing only two or three Men to\\ncome towards them without Arms, did not oppose them, but having challenged\\nthem, and they answering they were Friends, they lead them to their Body,\\nwhere they delivered their Message; at first, they apprehended it was a\\nStratagem to decoy them on Board, but when the Ambassadors offered that the\\nCaptain himself, and as many of the Crew as they should name, would meet\\nthem on Shore without Arms, they believed them to be in Earnest, and they\\nsoon entered into a Confidence with one another; those on Board going on\\nShore, and some of those on Shore going on Board.\\n\\nThe Sloops Men were rejoiced at the new Ally, for their Vessels were so\\nsmall, that they could not attack a Ship of any Force, so that hitherto\\nthey had not taken any considerable Prize, but now they hop'd to fly at\\nhigh Game; and _Avery_ was as well pleased at this Reinforcement, to\\nstrengthen them, for any brave Enterprize, and tho' the Booty must be\\nlessened to each, by being divided into so many Shares, yet he found out an\\nExpedient not to suffer by it himself as shall be shewn in its Place.\\n\\nHaving consulted what was to be done, they resolved to sail out together\\nupon a Cruize, the Galley and two Sloops; they therefore fell to work to\\nget the Sloops off, which they soon effected, and steered towards the\\n_Arabian_ Coast; near the River _Indus_, the Man at the Mast-Head spied a\\nSail, upon which they gave Chace, and as they came nearer to her, they\\nperceived her to be a tall Ship, and fancied she might be a _Dutch\\nEast-India_ Man homeward bound; but she proved a better Prize; when they\\nfired at her to bring too, she hoisted _Mogul_'s Colours, and seemed to\\nstand upon her Defence; _Avery_ only canonaded at a Distance, and some of\\nhis Men began to suspect that he was not the Hero they took him for:\\nHowever, the Sloops made Use of their Time, and coming one on the Bow, and\\nthe other on the Quarter, of the Ship, clapt her on Board, and enter'd her,\\nupon which she immediately struck her Colours and yielded; she was one of\\nthe _Great Mogul_'s own Ships, and there were in her several of the\\ngreatest Persons of his Court, among whom it was said was one of his\\nDaughters, who were going on a Pilgrimage to _Mecca_, the _Mahometans_\\nthinking themselves obliged once in their Lives to visit that Place, and\\nthey were carrying with them rich Offerings to present at the Shrine of\\n_Mahomet_. It is known that the Eastern People travel with the utmost\\nMagnificence, so that they had with them all their Slaves and Attendants,\\ntheir rich Habits and Jewels, with Vessels of Gold and Silver, and great\\nSums of Money to defray the Charges of their Journey by Land; wherefore the\\nPlunder got by this Prize, is not easily computed.\\n\\nHaving taken all the Treasure on Board their own Ships, and plundered their\\nPrize of every Thing else they either wanted or liked, they let her go; she\\nnot being able to continue her Voyage, returned back: As soon as the News\\ncame to the _Mogul_, and he knew that they were _English_ who had robbed\\nthem, he threatened loud, and talked of sending a mighty Army with Fire and\\nSword, to extirpate the _English_ from all their Settlements on the\\n_Indian_ Coast. The _East-India_ Company in _England_, were very much\\nalarmed at it; however, by Degrees, they found Means to pacify him, by\\npromising to do their Endeavours to take the Robbers, and deliver them into\\nhis Hands; however, the great Noise this Thing made in Europe, as well as\\n_India_, was the Occasion of all these romantick Stories which were formed\\nof _Avery_'s Greatness.\\n\\nIn the mean Time our successful Plunderers agreed to make the best of their\\nWay back to _Madagascar_, intending to make that Place their Magazine or\\nRepository for all their Treasure, and to build a small Fortification\\nthere, and leave a few Hands always ashore to look after it, and defend it\\nfrom any Attempts of the Natives; but _Avery_ put an End to this Project,\\nand made it altogether unnecessary.\\n\\nAs they were Steering their Course, as has been said, he sends a Boat on\\nBoard of each of the Sloops, desiring the Chief of them to come on Board of\\nhim, in order to hold a Council; they did so, and he told them he had\\nsomething to propose to them for the common Good, which was to provide\\nagainst Accidents; he bad them consider the Treasure they were possess'd\\nof, would be sufficient for them all if they could secure it in some Place\\non Shore; therefore all they had to fear, was some Misfortune in the\\nVoyage; he bad them consider the Consequences of being separated by bad\\nWeather, in which Case, the Sloops, if either of them should fall in with\\nany Ships of Force, must be either taken or sunk, and the Treasure on Board\\nher lost to the rest, besides the common Accidents of the Sea; as for his\\nPart he was so strong, he was able to make his Party good with any Ship\\nthey were like to meet in those Seas; that if he met with any Ship of such\\nStrength, that he could not take her, he was safe from being taken, being\\nso well mann'd; besides his Ship was a quick Sailor, and could carry Sail,\\nwhen the Sloops could not, wherefore, he proposed to them, to put the\\nTreasure on Board his Ship, to seal up each Chest with 3 Seals, whereof\\neach was to keep one, and to appoint a Rendezvous, in Case of Separation.\\n\\nUpon considering this Proposal, it appeared so seasonable to them, that\\nthey readily came into it, for they argued to themselves, that an Accident\\nmight happen to one of the Sloops and the other escape, wherefore it was\\nfor the common Good. The Thing was done as agreed to, the Treasure put on\\nBoard of _Avery_, and the Chests seal'd; they kept Company that Day and the\\nnext, the Weather being fair, in which Time _Avery_ tampered with his Men,\\ntelling them they now had sufficient, to make them all easy, and what\\nshould hinder them from going to some Country, where they were not known,\\nand living on Shore all the rest of their Days in Plenty; they understood\\nwhat he meant: And in short, they all agreed to bilk their new Allies, the\\nSloop's Men, nor do I find that any of them felt any Qualms of Honour\\nrising in his Stomach, to hinder them from consenting to this Piece of\\nTreachery. In fine, they took Advantage of the Darkness that Night, steer'd\\nanother Course, and, by Morning, lost Sight of them.\\n\\nI leave the Reader to judge, what Swearing and Confusion there was among\\nthe Sloop's Men, in the Morning, when they saw that _Avery_ had given them\\nthe Slip; for they knew by the Fairness of the Weather, and the Course they\\nhad agreed to steer, that it must have been done on purpose: But we leave\\nthem at present to follow Mr. _Avery_.\\n\\n_Avery_, and his Men, having consulted what to do with themselves, came to\\na Resolution, to make the best of their Way towards _America_; and none of\\nthem being known in those Parts, they intended to divide the Treasure, to\\nchange their Names, to go ashore, some in one Place, some in other, to\\npurchase some Settlements, and live at Ease. The first Land they made, was\\nthe Island of _Providence_, then newly settled; here they staid some Time,\\nand having considered that when they should go to _New-England_, the\\nGreatness of their Ship, would cause much Enquiry about them; and possibly\\nsome People from _England_, who had heard the Story of a Ship's being run\\naway with from the _Groine_, might suspect them to be the People; they\\ntherefore took a Resolution of disposing of their Ship at _Providence_:\\nUpon which, _Avery_ pretending that the Ship being fitted out upon the\\nprivateering Account, and having had no Success, he had received Orders\\nfrom the Owners, to dispose of her to the best Advantage, he soon met with\\na Purchaser, and immediately bought a sloop.\\n\\nIn this Sloop, he and his Companions embarq'd, they touch'd at several\\nParts of _America_, where no Person suspected them; and some of them went\\non Shore, and dispersed themselves about the Country, having received such\\nDividends as _Avery_ would give them; for he concealed the greatest Part of\\nthe Diamonds from them, which in the first Hurry of plundering the Ship,\\nthey did not much regard, as not knowing their Value.\\n\\nAt length he came to _Boston_, in _New-England_, and seem'd to have a\\nDesire of settling in those Parts, and some of his Companions went on Shore\\nthere also, but he changed his Resolution, and proposed to the few of his\\nCompanions who were left, to sail for _Ireland_, which they consented to:\\nHe found out that _New-England_ was not a proper Place for him, because a\\ngreat deal of his Wealth lay in Diamonds; and should he have produced them\\nthere, he would have certainly been seiz'd on Suspicion of Pyracy.\\n\\nIn their Voyage to Ireland, they avoided St. _George_'s Channel, and\\nsailing North about, they put into one of the Northern Ports of that\\nKingdom; there they disposed of their Sloop, and coming on Shore they\\nseparated themselves, some going to _Cork_, and some to _Dublin_, 18 of\\nwhom obtain'd their Pardons afterwards of K. _William_. When _Avery_ had\\nremain'd some Time in this Kingdom, he was afraid to offer his Diamonds to\\nsale, least an Enquiry into his Manner of coming by them should occasion a\\nDiscovery; therefore considering with himself what was best to be done, he\\nfancied there were some Persons at _Bristol_, whom he might venture to\\ntrust; upon which, he resolved to pass over into _England_; he did so, and\\ngoing into _Devonshire_, he sent to one of these Friends to meet him at a\\nTown called _Biddiford_; when he had communicated himself to his Friends,\\nand consulted with him about the Means of his Effects, they agreed, that\\nthe safest Method would be, to put them in the Hands of some Merchants, who\\nbeing Men of Wealth and Credit in the World, no Enquiry would be made how\\nthey came by them; this Friend telling him he was very intimate with some\\nwho were very fit for the Purpose, and if he would but allow them a good\\nCommission would do the Business very faithfully. _Avery_ liked the\\nProposal, for he found no other Way of managing his Affairs, since he could\\nnot appear in them himself; therefore his Friend going back to _Bristol_,\\nand opening the Matter to the Merchants, they made _Avery_ a Visit at\\n_Biddiford_, where, after some Protestations of Honour and Integrity, he\\ndelivered them his Effects, consisting of Diamonds and some Vessels of\\nGold; they gave him a little Money for his present Subsistance, and so they\\nparted.\\n\\nHe changed his Name and lived at _Biddiford_, without making any Figure,\\nand therefore there was no great Notice taken of him; yet let one or two of\\nhis Relations know where he was, who came to see him. In some Time his\\nlittle Money was spent, yet he heard nothing from his Merchants; he writ to\\nthem often, and after much Importunity they sent him a small Supply, but\\nscarce sufficient to pay his Debts: In fine, the Supplies they sent him\\nfrom Time to Time, were so small, that they were not sufficient to give him\\nBread, nor could he get that little, without a great deal of Trouble and\\nImportunity, wherefore being weary of his Life, he went privately to\\n_Bristol_, to speak to the Merchants himself, where instead of Money he met\\na most shocking Repulse, for when he desired them to come to an Account\\nwith him, they silenced him by threatening to discover him, so that our\\nMerchants were as good Pyrates at Land as he was at Sea.\\n\\nWhether he was frightened by these Menaces, or had seen some Body else he\\nthought knew him, is not known; but he went immediately over to _Ireland_,\\nand from thence sollicited his Merchants very hard for a Supply, but to no\\nPurpose, for he was even reduced to beggary: In this Extremity he was\\nresolved to return and cast himself upon them, let the Consequence be what\\nit would. He put himself on Board a trading Vessel, and work'd his Passage\\nover to _Plymouth_, from whence he travelled on Foot to _Biddiford_, where\\nhe had been but a few Days before he fell sick and died; not being worth as\\nmuch as would buy him a Coffin.\\n\\nThus have I given all that could be collected of any Certainty concerning\\nthis Man; rejecting the idle Stories which were made of his fantastick\\nGreatness, by which it appears, that his Actions were more inconsiderable\\nthan those of other Pyrates, since him, though he made more Noise in the\\nWorld.\\n\\nNow we shall turn back and give our Readers some Account of what became of\\nthe two Sloops.\\n\\nWe took Notice of the Rage and Confusion, which must have seized them, upon\\ntheir missing of _Avery_; however, they continued their Course, some of\\nthem still flattering themselves that he had only out sailed them in the\\nNight, and that they should find him at the Place of Rendezvous: But when\\nthey came there, and could hear no Tydings of him, there was an End of\\nHope. It was Time to consider what they should do with themselves, their\\nStock of Sea Provision was almost spent, and tho' there was Rice and Fish,\\nand Fowl to be had ashore, yet these would not keep for Sea, without being\\nproperly cured with Salt, which they had no Conveniency of doing;\\ntherefore, since they could not go a Cruizing any more, it was Time to\\nthink of establishing themselves at Land; to which Purpose they took all\\nThings out of the Sloops, made Tents of the Sails, and encamped themselves,\\nhaving a large Quantity of Ammunition, and abundance of small Arms.\\n\\nHere they met with several of their Countrymen, the Crew of a Privateer\\nSloop which was commanded by Captain _Thomas Tew_; and since it will be but\\na short Digression, we will give an Account how they came here.\\n\\nCaptain _George Dew_ and Captain _Thomas Tew_, having received Commissions\\nfrom the then Governor of _Bermudas_, to sail directly for the River\\n_Gambia_ in _Africa_; there, with the Advice and Assistance of the Agents\\nof the Royal _African_ Company, to attempt the taking the _French_ Factory\\nat _Goorie_, lying upon that Coast. In a few Days after they sailed out,\\n_Dew_ in a violent Storm, not only sprung his Mast, but lost Sight of his\\nConsort; _Dew_ therefore returned back to refit, and _Tew_ instead of\\nproceeding on his Voyage, made for the _Cape of Good Hope_, and doubling\\nthe said Cape, shaped his Course for the Straits of _Babel Mandel_, being\\nthe Entrance into the _Red Sea_. Here he came up with a large Ship, richly\\nladen, bound from the _Indies_ to _Arabia_, with three hundred Soldiers on\\nBoard, besides Seamen; yet _Tew_ had the Hardiness to board her, and soon\\ncarried her; and, 'tis said, by this Prize, his Men shared near three\\nthousand Pounds a Piece: They had Intelligence from the Prisoners, of five\\nother rich Ships to pass that Way, which _Tew_ would have attacked, tho'\\nthey were very strong, if he had not been over-ruled by the Quarter-Master\\nand others.--This differing in Opinion created some ill Blood amongst them,\\nso that they resolved to break up pyrating, and no Place was so fit to\\nreceive them as _Madagascar_; hither they steered, resolving to live on\\nShore and enjoy what they got.\\n\\nAs for _Tew_ himself, he with a few others in a short Time went off to\\n_Rhode Island_, from whence he made his Peace.\\n\\nThus have we accounted for the Company our Pyrates met with here.\\n\\nIt must be observed that the Natives of _Madagascar_ are a kind of Negroes,\\nthey differ from those of _Guiney_ in their Hair, which is long, and their\\nComplexion is not so good a Jet; they have innumerable little Princes among\\nthem, who are continually making War upon one another; their Prisoners are\\ntheir Slaves, and they either sell them, or put them to death, as they\\nplease: When our Pyrates first settled amongst them, their Alliance was\\nmuch courted by these Princes, so they sometimes joined one, sometimes\\nanother, but wheresoever they sided, they were sure to be Victorious; for\\nthe Negroes here had no Fire-Arms, nor did they understand their Use; so\\nthat at length these Pyrates became so terrible to the Negroes, that if two\\nor or three of them were only seen on one Side, when they were going to\\nengage, the opposite Side would fly without striking a Blow.\\n\\nBy these Means they not only became feared, but powerful; all the Prisoners\\nof War, they took to be their Slaves; they married the most beautiful of\\nthe Negroe Women; not one or two, but as many as they liked; so that every\\none of them had as great a Seraglio as the Grand Seignior at\\n_Constantinople_: Their Slaves they employed in planting Rice, in Fishing,\\nHunting, _&c._ besides which, they had abundance of others, who lived, as\\nit were, under their Protection, and to be secure from the Disturbances or\\nAttacks of their powerful Neighbours; these seemed to pay them a willing\\nHomage. Now they began to divide from one another, each living with his own\\nWives, Slaves and Dependants, like a separate Prince; and as Power and\\nPlenty naturally beget Contention, they sometimes quarrelled with one\\nanother, and attacked each other at the Head of their several Armies; and\\nin these civil Wars, many of them were killed; but an Accident happened,\\nwhich obliged them to unite again for their common Safety.\\n\\nIt must be observed that these sudden great Men, had used their Power like\\nTyrants, for they grew wanton in Cruelty, and nothing was more common, than\\nupon the slightest Displeasure, to cause one of their Dependants to be tied\\nto a Tree and shot thro' the Heart, let the Crime be what it would, whether\\nlittle or great, this was always the Punishment; wherefore the Negroes\\nconspired together, to rid themselves of these Destroyers, all in one\\nNight; and as they now lived separate, the Thing might easily have been\\ndone, had not a Woman, who had been Wife or Concubine to one of them, run\\nnear twenty Miles in three Hours, to discover the Matter to them:\\nImmediately upon the Alarm they ran together as fast as they could, so that\\nwhen the Negroes approached them, they found them all up in Arms; wherefore\\nthey retired without making any Attempt.\\n\\nThis Escape made them very cautious from that Time, and it will be worth\\nwhile to describe the Policy of these brutish Fellows, and to shew what\\nMeasures they took to secure themselves.\\n\\nThey found that the Fear of their Power could not secure them against a\\nSurprize, and the bravest Man may be kill'd when he is asleep, by one much\\nhis inferior in Courage and Strength, therefore, as their first Security,\\nthey did all they could to foment War betwixt the neighbouring Negroes,\\nremaining Neuter themselves, by which Means, those who were overcome\\nconstantly lied to them for Protection, otherwise they must be either\\nkilled or made Slaves. They strengthened their Party, and tied some to them\\nby interest; when there was no War, they contrived to spirit up private\\nQuarrels among them, and upon every little Dispute or Misunderstanding,\\npush on one Side or other to Revenge; instruct them how to attack or\\nsurprize their Adversaries, and lend them loaded Pistols or Firelocks to\\ndispatch them with; the Consequence of which was, that the Murderer was\\nforced to fly to them for the safety of his Life, with his Wives, Children\\nand Kindred.\\n\\nSuch as these were fast Friends, as their Lives depended upon the safety of\\nhis Protectors; for as we observed before, our Pyrates were grown so\\nterrible, that none of their Neighbours had Resolution enough to attack\\nthem in an open War.\\n\\nBy such Arts as these, in the Space of a few Years, their Body was greatly\\nincreased, they then began to separate themselves, and remove at a greater\\nDistance from one another, for the Convenience of more Ground, and were\\ndivided like Jews, into Tribes, each carrying with him his Wives and\\nChildren, (of which, by this Time they had a large Family,) as also their\\nQuota of Dependants and Followers; and if Power and Command be the Thing\\nwhich distinguish a Prince, these Ruffians had all the Marks of Royalty\\nabout them, nay more, they had the very Fears which commonly disturb\\nTyrants, as may be seen by the extream Caution they took in fortifying the\\nPlaces where they dwelt.\\n\\nIn this Plan of Fortification they imitated one another, their Dwellings\\nwere rather Citadels than Houses; they made Choice of a Place overgrown\\nwith Wood, and scituate near a Water; they raised a Rampart or high Ditch\\nround it, so strait and high, that it was impossible to climb it, and\\nespecially by those who had not the Use of scaling Ladders: Over this Ditch\\nthere was one Passage into the Wood; the Dwelling, which was a Hut, was\\nbuilt in that Part of the Wood which the Prince, who inhabited it, thought\\nfit, but so covered that it could not be seen till you came at it; but the\\ngreatest Cunning lay in the Passage which lead to the Hut, which was so\\nnarrow, that no more than one Person could go a Breast, and contrived in so\\nintricate a Manner, that it was a perfect Maze or Labyrinth, it being round\\nand round, with several little cross Ways, so that a Person that was not\\nwell acquainted with the Way, might walk several Hours round and cross\\nthese Ways without being able to find the Hut; moreover all along the Sides\\nof these narrow Paths, certain large Thorns which grew upon a Tree in that\\nCountry, were struck into the Ground with their Points uppermost, and the\\nPath it self being made crooked and serpentine, if a Man should attempt to\\ncome near the Hut at Night, he would certainly have struck upon these\\nThorns, tho' he had been provided with that Clue which _Ariadne_ gave to\\n_Theseus_ when he entered the Cave of the _Minataur_.\\n\\nThus Tyrant like they lived, fearing and feared by all; and in this\\nScituation they were found by Captain _Woods Rogers_, when he went to\\n_Madagascar_, in the _Delicia_, a Ship of forty Guns, with a Design of\\nbuying Slaves in order to sell to the _Dutch_ at _Batavia_ or\\n_New-Holland_: He happened to touch upon a Part of the Island, where no\\nShip had been seen for seven or eight Years before, where he met with some\\nof the Pyrates, at which Time, they had been upon the Island above 25\\nYears, having a large motly Generation of Children and Grand-Children\\ndescended from them, there being about that Time, eleven of them remaining\\nalive.\\n\\nUpon their first seeing a Ship of this Force and Burthen, they supposed it\\nto be a Man of War sent to take them; they therefore lurked within their\\nFastnesses, but when some from the Ship came on Shore, without any shew of\\nHostility, and offering to trade with the Negroes, they ventured to come\\nout of their Holes, attended like Princes; and since they actually are\\nKings _De Facto_, which is a kind of a Right, we ought to speak of them as\\nsuch.\\n\\nHaving been so many Years upon this Island, it may be imagined, their\\nCloaths had long been worn out, so that their Majesties were extreamly out\\nat the Elbows; I cannot say they were ragged, since they had no Cloaths,\\nthey had nothing to cover them but the Skins of Beasts without any tanning,\\nbut with all the Hair on, nor a Shoe nor Stocking, so they looked like the\\nPictures of _Hercules_ in the Lion's Skin; and being overgrown with Beard,\\nand Hair upon their Bodies, they appeared the most savage Figures that a\\nMan's Imagination can frame.\\n\\nHowever, they soon got rigg'd, for they sold great Numbers of those poor\\nPeople under them, for Cloaths, Knives, Saws, Powder and Ball, and many\\nother Things, and became so familiar that they went aboard the _Delicia_,\\nand were observed to be very curious, examining the inside of the Ship, and\\nvery familiar with the Men, inviting them ashore. Their Design in doing\\nthis, as they afterwards confessed, was to try if it was not practicable to\\nsurprize the Ship in the Night, which they judged very easy, in case there\\nwas but a slender Watch kept on Board, they having Boats and Men enough at\\nCommand, but it seems the Captain was aware of them, and kept so strong a\\nWatch upon Deck, that they found it was in vain to make any Attempt;\\nwherefore, when some of the Men went ashore, they were for inveigling them,\\nand drawing them into a Plot, for seizing the Captain and securing the rest\\nof the Men under Hatches, when they should have the Night-Watch, promising\\na Signal to come on Board to join them; proposing, if they succeeded, to go\\na Pyrating together, not doubting but with that Ship they should be able to\\ntake any Thing they met on the Sea: But the Captain observing an intimacy\\ngrowing betwixt them and some of his Men, thought it could be for no good,\\nhe therefore broke it off in Time, not suffering them so much as to talk\\ntogether; and when he sent a Boat on Shore with an Officer to treat with\\nthem about the Sale of Slaves, the Crew remained on Board the Boat, and no\\nMan was suffered to talk with them, but the Person deputed by him for that\\nPurpose.\\n\\nBefore he sailed away, and they found that nothing was to be done, they\\nconfessed all the Designs they had formed against him. Thus he left them as\\nhe found them, in a great deal of dirty State and Royalty, but with fewer\\nSubjects than they had, having, as we observed, sold many of them; and if\\nAmbition be the darling Passion of Men, no doubt they were happy. One of\\nthese great Princes had formerly been a Waterman upon the _Thames_, where\\nhaving committed a Murder, he fled to the _West-Indies_, and was of the\\nNumber of those who run away with the Sloops; the rest had been all\\nforemast Men, nor was there a Man amongst them, who could either read or\\nwrite, and yet their Secretaries of State had no more Learning than\\nthemselves. This is all the Account we can give of these Kings of\\n_Madagascar_, some of whom it is probable are reigning to this Day.\\n\\nCHAP. II. OF Captain _MARTEL_, And his CREW.\\n\\nI Come now to the Pyrates that have rose since the Peace of\\n_Utrecht_; in War Time there is no room for any, because all those of a\\nroving advent'rous Disposition find Employment in Privateers, so there is\\nno Opportunity for Pyrates; like our Mobs in London, when they come to any\\nHeight, our Superiors order out the Train Bands, and when once they are\\nraised, the others are suppressed of Course; I take the Reason of it to be,\\nthat the Mob go into the tame Army, and immediately from notorious Breakers\\nof the Peace, become, by being put into order, solemn Preservers of it. And\\nshould our Legislators put some of the Pyrates into Authority, it would not\\nonly lessen their Number, but, I imagine, set them upon the rest, and they\\nwould be the likeliest People to find them out, according to the Proverb,\\n_set a Thief to catch a Thief._\\n\\nTo bring this about, there needs no other Encouragement, but to give all\\nthe Effects taken aboard a Pyrate Vessel to the Captors; for in Case of\\nPlunder and Gain, they like it as well from Friends, as Enemies, but are\\nnot fond, as Things are carry'd, _of ruining poor Fellowes_, say the\\n_Creoleans, with no Advantage to themselves._\\n\\nThe Multitude of Men and Vessels, employ'd this Way, in Time of War, in the\\n_West-Indies_, is another Reason, for the Number of Pyrates in a Time of\\nPeace: This cannot be supposed to be a Reflection on any of our _American_\\nGovernments, much less on the King himself, by whose Authority such\\nCommissions are granted, because of the Reasonableness, and absolute\\nNecessity, there is for the doing of it; yet the Observation is just, for\\nso many idle People employing themselves in Privateers, for the sake of\\nPlunder and Riches, which they always spend as fast as they get, that when\\nthe War is over, and they can have no farther Business in the Way of Life\\nthey have been used to, they too readily engage in Acts of Pyracy, which\\nbeing but the same Practice without a Commission, they make very little\\nDistinction betwixt the Lawfulness of one, and the Unlawfulness of the\\nother.\\n\\nI have not enquired so far back, as to know the Original of this Rover, but\\nI believe he and his Gang, were some Privateer's Men belonging to the\\nIsland of _Jamaica_, in the preceeding War; his Story is but short, for his\\nReign was so; an End having been put to his Adventures in good Time, when\\nhe was growing strong and formidable. We find him Commander of a Pyrate\\nSloop of eight Guns, and 80 Men, in the Month of _September_, 1716,\\ncruising off _Jamaica_, _Cuba_, _&c._ about which Time he took the\\n_Berkley_ Galley, Captain _Saunders_, and plundered him of 1000 _l._ in\\nMoney, and afterwards met with a Sloop call'd the _King Solomon_, from whom\\nhe took some Money, and Provisions, besides Goods, to a good Value.\\n\\nThey proceeded after this to the Port of _Cavena_, at the Island of _Cuba_,\\nand in their Way took two Sloops, which they plundered, and let go; and off\\nthe Port fell in with a fine Galley, with 20 Guns, call'd the _John_ and\\n_Martha_, Captain _Wilson_, which they attacked under the pyratical\\nBlack-Flag, and made themselves Masters of her. They put some of the Men\\nashore, and others they detain'd, as they had done several Times, to\\nencrease their Company; but Captain _Martel_, charged Captain _Wilson_, to\\nadvise his Owners, that their Ship would answer his Purpose exactly, by\\ntaking one Deck down, and as for the Cargo, which consisted chiefly of\\nLogwood and Sugar, he would take Care it should be carry'd to a good\\nMarket.\\n\\nHaving fitted up the aforesaid Ship, as they design'd, they mounted her\\nwith 22 Guns, 100 Men, and left 25 Hands in the Sloop, and so proceeded to\\nCruize off the _Leeward_ Islands, where they met with but too much Success.\\nAfter the taking of a Sloop and a Brigantine, they gave Chase to a stout\\nShip, which they came up with, and, at Sight of the Pyrate's Flag, she\\nstruck to the Robbers, being a Ship of 20 Guns, call'd the _Dolphin_, bound\\nfor _Newfoundland_. Captain _Martel_ made the Men Prisoners, and carry'd\\nthe Ship with him.\\n\\nThe middle of _December_ the Pyrates took another Galley in her Voyage home\\nfrom _Jamaica_, call'd the _Kent_, Captain _Lawton_, and shifted her\\nProvisions aboard their own Ship, and let her go, which obliged her to Sail\\nback to _Jamaica_ for a Supply for her Voyage. After this they met with a\\nsmall Ship and a Sloop, belonging to _Barbadoes_, out of both they took\\nProvisions, and then parted with them, having first taken out some of their\\nHands, who were willing to be forced to go along with them. The _Greyhound_\\nGalley of _London_, Captain _Evans_, from _Guiney_ to _Jamaica_, was the\\nnext that had the Misfortune to fall in their Way, which they did not\\ndetain long, for as soon as they could get out all her Gold Dust,\\nElephant's Teeth, and 40 Slaves, they sent her onwards upon her Voyage.\\n. . . . .\\n\\nThey concluded now, that 'twas high Time to get into Harbour and refit, as\\nwell as to get Refreshments themselves, and wait an Opportunity to dispose\\nof their Cargo; therefore 'twas resolved to make the best of their Way to\\n_Santa Crux_, a small Island in the Lattitude of 18, 30, N. ten Mile long,\\nand two broad, lying South-East of _Porto Rico_, belonging to the _French_\\nSettlements. Here they thought they might lye privately enough for some\\nTime, and fit themselves for further Mischief. They met with a Sloop by the\\nWay, which they took along with them, and in the Beginning of the Year\\n1716-17, they arrived at their Port, having a Ship of 20 Guns, a Sloop of\\neight, and three Prizes, _viz._ another Ship of 20 Guns, a Sloop of four\\nGuns, and another Sloop last taken; with this little Fleet, they got into a\\nsmall Harbour, or Road, the N. W. Part of the Island, and warp'd up two\\nCreeks, which were made by a little Island lying within the Bay; (I am the\\nmore particular now, because I shall take Leave of the Gentlemen, at this\\nPlace.) They had here bare 16 Foot Water, at the deepest, and but 13 or 14,\\nat the shallowest, and nothing but Rocks and Sands without, which secured\\nthem from Wind and Sea, and likewise from any considerable Force coming\\nagainst them.\\n\\nWhen they had all got in, the first Thing they had to do, was to Guard\\nthemselves in the best Manner they could; they made a Battery of four Guns\\nupon the Island, and another Battery of two Guns on the North Point of the\\nRoad, and warp'd in one of the Sloops with eight Guns, at the Mouth of the\\nChannel, to hinder any Vessels from coming in; when this was done they went\\nto Work on their Ship, unrigging, and unloading, in order to Clean, where I\\nshall leave them a while, till I bring other Company to 'em.\\n\\nIn the Month of _November_, 1716, General _Hamilton_, Commander in chief of\\nall the _Leeward Carribee Islands_, sent a Sloop Express to Captain _Hume_,\\nat _Barbadoes_, Commander of his Majesty's Ship, _Scarborough_, of 30 Guns,\\nand 140 Men, to acquaint him, that two Pyrate Sloops of 12 Guns each,\\nmolested the Colonies, having plundered several Vessels. The _Scarborough_\\nhad bury'd twenty Men, and had near forty Sick, and therefore was but in\\nill State to go to Sea: However, Captain _Hume_ left his sick Men behind,\\nand sailed to the other Islands, for a supply of Men, taking 20 Soldiers\\nfrom _Antegoa_; at _Nevis_, he took 10, and 10 at St. _Christophers_, and\\nthen sailed to the Island of _Anguilla_, where he learned, that some Time\\nbefore, 2 such Sloops had been at _Spanish-Town_, otherwise called, one of\\nthe _Virgin_ Islands: Accordingly, the next Day, the _Scarborough_ came to\\n_Spanish-Town_, but could hear no News of the Sloops, only, that they had\\nbeen there about _Christmas_, (it being then the 15th of _January_.)\\n\\nCaptain _Hume_, finding no Account could be had of these Pyrates, designed\\nto go back, the next Day, to _Barbadoes_; but, it happened, that Night,\\nthat a Boat anchor'd there from _Santa Crux_, and informed him, that he saw\\na Pyrate Ship of 22 or 24 Guns, with other Vessels, going in to the North\\nWest Part of the Island aforesaid. The _Scarborough_ weigh'd immediately,\\nand the next Morning came in Sight of the Rovers, and their Prizes, and\\nstood to them, but the Pilot refused to venture in with the Ship; all the\\nwhile the Pyrates fir'd red hot Bullets from the Shore. At length, the Ship\\ncame to an Anchor, along Side the Reef, near the Channel, and cannonaded\\nfor several Hours, both the Vessels and Batteries: About four in the\\nAfternoon, the Sloop that guarded the Channel, was sunk by the Shot of the\\nMan of War; then she cannonaded the Pyrate Ship of 22 Guns, that lay behind\\nthe Island. The next Night, _viz._ the 18th, it falling Calm, Captain\\n_Hume_ weigh'd, fearing he might fall on the Reef, and so stood off and on\\nfor a Day or two, to block them up. On the 20th, in the Evening, they\\nobserved the Man of War to stand off to Sea, and took the Opportunity to\\nwarp out, in order to slip away from the Island; but at Twelve o'Clock they\\nrun a-ground, and then seeing the _Scarborough_ about, standing in again,\\nas their Case was desperate, so they were put into the utmost Confusion;\\nthey quitted their Ship, and set her on Fire, with 20 Negroes in her, who\\nwere all burnt; 19 of the Pyrates made their Escape in a small Sloop, but\\nthe Captain and the rest, with 20 Negroes, betook to the Woods, where 'twas\\nprobable they might starve, for we never heard what became of 'em\\nafterwards: Captain _Hume_ released the Prisoners, with the Ship and Sloop\\nthat remained, and then went after the two Pyrate Sloops first mentioned.\\n\\nCHAP. III. OF Captain _TEACH_ alias BLACK-BEARD.\\n\\nE_Dward Teach_ was a _Bristol_ Man born, but had sailed some Time out\\nof _Jamaica_ in Privateers, in the late _French_ War; yet tho' he had often\\ndistinguished himself for his uncommon Boldness and personal Courage, he\\nwas never raised to any Command, till he went a-pyrating, which I think was\\nat the latter End of the Year 1716, when Captain _Benjamin Hornigold_ put\\nhim into a Sloop that he had made Prize of, and with whom he continued in\\nConsortship till a little while before _Hornigold_ surrendered.\\n\\nIn the Spring of the Year 1717, _Teach_ and _Hornigold_ sailed from\\n_Providence_, for the Main of _America_, and took in their Way a Billop\\nfrom the _Havana_, with 120 Barrels of Flower, as also a Sloop from\\n_Bermuda_, _Thurbar_ Master, from whom they took only some Gallons of Wine,\\nand then let him go; and a Ship from _Madera_ to _South-Carolina_, out of\\nwhich they got Plunder to a considerable Value.\\n\\nAfter cleaning on the Coast of _Virginia_, they returned to the\\n_West-Indies_, and in the Latitude of 24, made Prize of a large _French\\nGuiney_ Man, bound to _Martinico_, which by _Hornigold_'s Consent, _Teach_\\nwent aboard of as Captain, and took a Cruize in her; _Hornigold_ returned\\nwith his Sloop to _Providence_, where, at the Arrival of Captain _Rogers_,\\nthe Governor, he surrendered to Mercy, pursuant to the King's Proclamation.\\n\\nAboard of this _Guiney_ Man _Teach_ mounted no Guns, and named her the\\n_Queen Ann's Revenge_; and cruising near the Island of St. _Vincent_, took\\na large Ship, called the _Great Allen_, _Christopher Taylor_ Commander; the\\nPyrates plundered her of what they though fit, put all the Men ashore upon\\nthe Island above mentioned, and then set Fire to the Ship.\\n\\nA few Days after, _Teach_ fell in with the _Scarborogh_ Man of War, of 30\\nGuns, who engaged him for some Hours; but she finding the Pyrate well\\nmann'd, and having tried her strength, gave over the Engagement, and\\nreturned to _Barbadoes_, the Place of her Station; and _Teach_ sailed\\ntowards the _Spanish America_.\\n\\nIn his Way he met with a Pyrate Sloop of ten Guns, commanded by one Major\\n_Bonnet_, lately a Gentleman of good Reputation and Estate in the Island of\\n_Barbadoes_, whom he joyned; but in a few Days after, _Teach_, finding that\\n_Bonnet_ knew nothing of a maritime Life, with the Consent of his own Men,\\nput in another Captain, one _Richards_, to Command _Bonnet_'s Sloop, and\\ntook the Major on aboard his own Ship, telling him, that _as he had not\\nbeen used to the Fatigues and Care of such a Post, it would be better for\\nhim to decline it, and live easy and at his Pleasure, in such a Ship as\\nhis, where he should not be obliged to perform Duty, but follow his own\\nInclinations._\\n\\nAt _Turniff_ ten Leagues short of the Bay of _Honduras_, the Pyrates took\\nin fresh Water; and while they were at an Anchor there, they saw a Sloop\\ncoming in, whereupon, _Richards_ in the Sloop called the _Revenge_, slipped\\nhis Cable, and run out to meet her; who upon seeing the black Flag hoisted,\\nstruck his Sail and came to, under the Stern of _Teach_ the Commadore. She\\nwas called the _Adventure_, from _Jamaica_, _David Harriot_ Master. They\\ntook him and his Men aboard the great Ship, and sent a Number of other\\nHands with _Israel Hands_, Master of _Teach_'s Ship, to Man the Sloop for\\nthe pyratical Account.\\n\\nThe 9th of April, they weighed from _Turniff_, having lain there about a\\nWeek, and sailed to the Bay, where they found a Ship and four Sloops, three\\nof the latter belonged to _Jonathan Bernard_, of _Jamaica_, and the other\\nto Captain _James_; the Ship was of _Boston_, called the _Protestant\\nCæsar_, Captain _Wyar_ Commander. _Teach_ hoisted his Black Colours, and\\nfired a Gun, upon which Captain _Wyar_ and all his Men, left their Ship,\\nand got ashore in their Boat. _Teach_'s Quarter-Master, and eight of his\\nCrew, took Possession of _Wyar_'s Ship, and _Richards_ secured all the\\nSloops, one of which they burnt out of spight to the Owner; the _Protestant\\nCæsar_ they also burnt, after they had plundered her, because she belonged\\nto _Boston_, where some Men had been hanged for Pyracy; and the three\\nSloops belonging to _Bernard_ they let go.\\n\\nFrom hence the Rovers sailed to _Turkill_, and then to the _Grand\\nCaimanes_, a small Island about thirty Leagues to the Westward of\\n_Jamaica_, where they took a small Turtler, and so to the _Havana_, and\\nfrom thence to the _Bahama_ Wrecks, and from the _Bahama_ Wrecks, they\\nsailed to _Carolina_, taking a Brigantine and two Sloops in their Way,\\nwhere they lay off the Bar of _Charles-Town_ for five or six Days. They\\ntook here a Ship as she was coming out, bound for London, commanded by\\n_Robert Clark_, with some Passengers on Board for _England_; the next Day\\nthey took another Vessel coming out of _Charles-Town_, and also two Pinks\\ncoming into _Charles-Town_; likewise a Brigantine with 14 Negroes aboard;\\nall which being done in the Face of the Town, struck a great Terror to the\\nwhole Province of _Carolina_, having just before been visited by _Vane_,\\nanother notorious Pyrate, that they abandoned themselves to Dispair, being\\nin no Condition to resist their Force. They were eight Sail in the Harbour,\\nready for the Sea, but none dared to venture out, it being almost\\nimpossible to escape their Hands. The inward bound Vessels were under the\\nsame unhappy Dilemma, so that the Trade of this Place was totally\\ninterrupted: What made these Misfortunes heavier to them, was a long\\nexpensive War, the Colony had had with the Natives, which was but just\\nended when these Robbers infested them.\\n\\n_Teach_ detained all the Ships and Prisoners, and, being in want of\\nMedicines, resolves to demand a Chest from the Government of the Province;\\naccordingly _Richards_, the Captain of the _Revenge_ Sloop, with two or\\nthree more Pyrates, were sent up along with Mr. _Marks_, one of the\\nPrisoners, whom they had taken in _Clark_'s Ship, and very insolently made\\ntheir Demands, threatning, that if they did not send immediately the Chest\\nof Medicines, and let the Pyrate-Ambassadors return, without offering any\\nViolence to their Persons, they would murder all their Prisoners, send up\\ntheir Heads to the Governor, and set the Ships they had taken on Fire.\\n\\nWhilst Mr. _Marks_ was making Application to the Council, _Richards_, and\\nthe rest of the Pyrates, walk'd the Streets publickly, in the Sight of all\\nPeople, who were fired with the utmost Indignation, looking upon them as\\nRobbers and Murtherers, and particularly the Authors of their Wrongs and\\nOppressions, but durst not so much as think of executing their Revenge, for\\nfear of bringing more Calamities upon themselves, and so they were forced\\nto let the Villains pass with Impunity. The Government were not long in\\ndeliberating upon the Message, tho' 'twas the greatest Affront that could\\nhave been put upon them; yet for the saving so many Mens Lives, (among\\nthem, Mr. _Samuel Wragg_, one of the Council;) they comply'd with the\\nNecessity, and sent aboard a Chest, valued at between 3 and 400 _l._ and\\nthe Pyrates went back safe to their Ships.\\n\\n_Blackbeard_, (for so _Teach_ was generally called, as we shall hereafter\\nshew) as soon as he had received the Medicines and his Brother Rogues, let\\ngo the Ships and the Prisoners; having first taken out of them in Gold and\\nSilver, about 1500 _l._ Sterling, besides Provisions and other Matters.\\n\\nFrom the Bar of _Charles-Town_, they sailed to _North-Carolina_; Captain\\n_Teach_ in the Ship, which they called the Man of War, Captain _Richards_\\nand Captain _Hands_ in the Sloops, which they termed Privateers, and\\nanother Sloop serving them as a Tender. _Teach_ began now to think of\\nbreaking up the Company, and securing the Money and the best of the Effects\\nfor himself, and some others of his Companions he had most Friendship for,\\nand to cheat the rest: Accordingly, on Pretence of running into _Topsail_\\nInlet to clean, he grounded his Ship, and then, as if it had been done\\nundesignedly, and by Accident; he orders _Hands_'s Sloop to come to his\\nAssistance, and get him off again, which he endeavouring to do, ran the\\nSloop on Shore near the other, and so were both lost. This done, _Teach_\\ngoes into the Tender Sloop, with forty Hands, and leaves the _Revenge_\\nthere; then takes seventeen others and Marroons them upon a small sandy\\nIsland, about a League from the Main, where there was neither Bird, Beast\\nor Herb for their Subsistance, and where they must have perished if Major\\n_Bonnet_ had not two Days after taken them off.\\n\\n_Teach_ goes up to the Governor of _North-Carolina_, with about twenty of\\nhis Men, surrender to his Majesty's Proclamation, and receive Certificates\\nthereof, from his Excellency; but it did not appear that their submitting\\nto this Pardon was from any Reformation of Manners, but only to wait a more\\nfavourable Opportunity to play the same Game over again; which he soon\\nafter effected, with greater Security to himself, and with much better\\nProspect of Success, having in this Time cultivated a very good\\nunderstanding with _Charles Eden_, Esq; the Governor above mentioned.\\n\\nThe first Piece of Service this kind Governor did to _Black-Beard_, was, to\\ngive him a Right to the Vessel which he had taken, when he was a pyrating\\nin the great Ship called the _Queen Ann's Revenge_; for which purpose, a\\nCourt of Vice-Admiralty was held at _Bath-Town_; and, tho' _Teach_ had\\nnever any Commission in his Life, and the Sloop belonging to the _English_\\nMerchants, and taken in Time of Peace; yet was she condemned as a Prize\\ntaken from the _Spaniards_, by the said _Teach_. These Proceedings shew\\nthat Governors are but Men.\\n\\nBefore he sailed upon his Adventures, he marry'd a young Creature of about\\nsixteen Years of Age, the Governor performing the Ceremony. As it is a\\nCustom to marry here by a Priest, so it is there by a Magistrate; and this,\\nI have been informed, made _Teach_'s fourteenth Wife, whereof, about a\\ndozen might be still living. His Behaviour in this State, was something\\nextraordinary; for, while his Sloop lay in _Okerecock_ Inlet, and he ashore\\nat a Plantation, where his Wife lived, with whom after he had lain all\\nNight, it was his Custom to invite five or six of his brutal Companions to\\ncome ashore, and he would force her to prostitute her self to them all, one\\nafter another, before his Face.\\n\\nIn _June_ 1718, he went to Sea, upon another Expedition, and steered his\\nCourse towards _Bermudas_; he met with two or three _English_ Vessels in\\nhis Way, but robbed them only of Provisions, Stores and other Necessaries,\\nfor his present Expence; but near the Island aforementioned, he fell in\\nwith two _French_ Ships, one of them was loaden with Sugar and Cocoa, and\\nthe other light, both bound to _Martinico_; the Ship that had no Lading he\\nlet go, and putting all the Men of the loaded Ship aboard her, he brought\\nhome the other with her Cargo to _North-Carolina_, where the Governor and\\nthe Pyrates shared the Plunder.\\n\\nWhen _Teach_ and his Prize arrived, he and four of his Crew went to his\\nExcellency, and made Affidavit, that they found the _French_ Ship at Sea,\\nwithout a Soul on Board her; and then a Court was called, and the Ship\\ncondemned: The Governor had sixty Hogsheads of Sugar for his Dividend, and\\none Mr. _Knight_, who was his Secretary, and Collector for the Province,\\ntwenty, and the rest was shared among the other Pyrates.\\n\\nThe Business was not yet done, the Ship remained, and it was possible one\\nor other might come into the River, that might be acquainted with her, and\\nso discover the Roguery; but _Teach_ thought of a Contrivance to prevent\\nthis, for, upon a Pretence that she was leaky, and that she might sink, and\\nso stop up the Mouth of the Inlet or Cove where she lay, he obtained an\\nOrder from the Governor, to bring her out into the River, and set her on\\nFire, which was accordingly executed, and she was burnt down to the Water's\\nEdge, her Bottom sunk, and with it, their Fears of her ever rising in\\nJudgment against them.\\n\\nCaptain _Teach_, alias _Black-beard_, passed three or four Months in the\\nRiver, sometimes lying at Anchor in the Coves, at other Times sailing from\\none Inlet to another, trading with such Sloops as he met, for the Plunder\\nhe had taken, and would often give them Presents for Stores and Provisions\\ntook from them; that is, when he happened to be in a giving Humour; at\\nother Times he made bold with them, and took what he liked, without saying,\\n_by your Leave_, knowing well, they dared not send him a Bill for the\\nPayment. He often diverted himself with going ashore among the Planters,\\nwhere he revelled Night and Day: By these he was well received, but whether\\nout of Love or Fear, I cannot say; sometimes he used them courteously\\nenough, and made them Presents of Rum and Sugar, in Recompence of what he\\ntook from them; but, as for Liberties (which 'tis said) he and his\\nCompanions often took with the Wives and Daughters of the Planters, I\\ncannot take upon me to say, whether he paid them _ad Valorem_, or no. At\\nother Times he carried it in a lordly Manner towards them, and would lay\\nsome of them under Contribution; nay, he often proceeded to bully the\\nGovernor, not, that I can discover the least Cause of Quarrel betwixt them,\\nbut it seemed only to be done, to shew he dared do it.\\n\\nThe Sloops trading up and down this River, being so frequently pillaged by\\n_Black-beard_, consulted with the Traders, and some of the best of the\\nPlanters, what Course to take; they, saw plainly it would be in vain to\\nmake any Application to the Governor of _North-Carolina_, to whom it\\nproperly belonged to find some Redress; so that if they could not be\\nrelieved from some other Quarter, _Black-beard_ would be like to reign with\\nImpunity, therefore, with as much Secrecy as possible, they sent a\\nDeputation to _Virginia_, to lay the Affair before the Governor of that\\nColony, and to solicit an armed Force from the Men of War lying there, to\\ntake or destroy this Pyrate.\\n\\nThis Governor consulted with the Captains of the two Men of War, _viz._ the\\n_Pearl_ and _Lime_, who had lain in St. _James_'s River, about ten Months.\\nIt was agreed that the Governor should hire a couple of small Sloops, and\\nthe Men of War, should Man them; this was accordingly done, and the Command\\nof them given to Mr. _Robert Maynard_, first Lieutenant of the _Pearl_, an\\nexperienced Officer, and a Gentleman of great Bravery and Resolution, as\\nwill appear by his gallant Behaviour in this Expedition. The Sloops were\\nwell mann'd and furnished with Ammunition and small Arms, but had no Guns\\nmounted.\\n\\nAbout the Time of their going out, the Governor called an Assembly, in\\nwhich it was resolved to publish a Proclamation, offering certain Rewards\\nto any Person or Persons, who, within a Year after that Time, should take\\nor destroy any Pyrate: The original Proclamation being in our Hands, is as\\nfollows.\\n\\nBy his Majesty's Lieutenant Governor, and, Commander in Chief, of\\nthe Colony and Dominion of _Virginia_,\\n\\nA PROCLAMATION,\\n\\nPublishing the Rewards given for apprehending, or killing, Pyrates.\\n\\nW_Hereas, by an Act of Assembly, made at a Session of Assembly, begun\\nat the Capital in _Williamsburgh_, the eleventh Day of _November_, in the\\nfifth Year of his Majesty's Reign, entituled, _An Act to encourage the\\napprehending and destroying of Pyrates_: It is, amongst other Things\\nenacted, that all and every Person, or Persons, who, from and after the\\nfourteenth Day of _November_, in the Year of our Lord one thousand seven\\nhundred and eighteen, and before the fourteenth Day of _November_, which\\nshall be in the Year of our Lord one thousand seven hundred and nineteen,\\nshall take any Pyrate, or Pyrates, on the Sea or Land, or in Case of\\nResistance, shall kill any such Pyrate, or Pyrates, between the Degrees of\\nthirty four, and thirty nine, of Northern Latitude, and within one hundred\\nLeagues of the Continent of _Virginia_, or within the Provinces of\\n_Virginia_, or _North-Carolina_, upon the Conviction, or making due Proof\\nof the killing of all, and every such Pyrate, and Pyrates, before the\\nGovernor and Council, shall be entitled to have, and receive out of the\\npublick Money, in the Hands of the Treasurer of this Colony, the several\\nRewards following; that is to say, for _Edward Teach_, commonly call'd\\nCaptain _Teach_, or _Black-Beard_, one hundred Pounds, for every other\\nCommander of a Pyrate Ship, Sloop, or Vessel, forty Pounds; for every\\nLieutenant, Master, or Quarter-Master, Boatswain, or Carpenter, twenty\\nPounds; for every other inferior Officer, sixteen Pounds, and for every\\nprivate Man taken on Board such Ship, Sloop, or Vessel, ten Pounds; and,\\nthat for every Pyrate, which shall be taken by any Ship, Sloop or Vessel,\\nbelonging to this Colony, or _North-Carolina_, within the Time aforesaid,\\nin any Place whatsoever, the like Rewards shall be paid according to the\\nQuality and Condition of such Pyrates. Wherefore, for the Encouragement of\\nall such Persons as shall be willing to serve his Majesty, and their\\nCountry, in so just and honourable an Undertaking, as the suppressing a\\nSort of People, who may be truly called Enemies to Mankind: I have thought\\nfit, with the Advice and Consent of his Majesty's Council, to issue this\\nProclamation, hereby declaring, the said Rewards shall be punctually and\\njustly paid, in current Money of _Virginia_, according to the Directions of\\nthe said Act. And, I do order and appoint this Proclamation, to be\\npublished by the Sheriffs, at their respective County-Houses, and by all\\nMinisters and Readers, in the several Churches and Chappels, throughout\\nthis Colony._\\n\\nGiven at our Council-Chamber at _Williamsburgh_, this 24th Day of\\n_November_, 1718, in the fifth Year of his Majesty's Reign.\\n\\nGOD SAVE THE KING.\\n\\n_A. SPOTSWOOD_.\\n\\nThe 17th of _November_, 1718, the Lieutenant sail'd from _Kicquetan_, in\\n_James_ River in _Virginia_, and, the 21st in the Evening, came to the\\nMouth of _Okerecock_ Inlet, where he got Sight of the Pyrate. This\\nExpedition was made with all imaginable Secrecy, and the Officer manag'd\\nwith all the Prudence that was necessary, stopping all Boats and Vessels he\\nmet with, in the River, from going up, and thereby preventing any\\nIntelligence from reaching _Black-Beard_, and receiving at the same time an\\nAccount from them all, of the Place where the Pyrate was lurking; but\\nnotwithstanding this Caution, _Black-beard_ had Information of the Design,\\nfrom his Excellency of the Province; and his Secretary, Mr. _Knight_, wrote\\nhim a Letter, particularly concerning it, intimating, _That he had sent him\\nfour of his Men, which were all he could meet with, in or about Town, and\\nso bid him be upon his Guard._ These Men belonged to _Black-beard_, and\\nwere sent from _Bath-Town_ to _Okerecock_ Inlet, where the Sloop lay, which\\nis about 20 Leagues.\\n\\n_Black-beard_ had heard several Reports, which happened not to be true, and\\nso gave the less Credit to this, nor was he convinced till he saw the\\nSloops: Whereupon he put his Vessel in a Posture of Defence; he had no more\\nthan twenty five Men on Board, tho' he gave out to all the Vessels he spoke\\nwith, that he had 40. When he had prepared for Battle, he set down and\\nspent the Night in drinking with the Master of a trading Sloop, who, 'twas\\nthought, had more Business with _Teach_, than he should have had.\\n\\nLieutenant _Maynard_ came to an Anchor, for the Place being shoal, and the\\nChannel intricate, there was no getting in, where _Teach_ lay, that Night;\\nbut in the Morning he weighed, and sent his Boat a-head of the Sloops to\\nsound; and coming within Gun-Shot of the Pyrate, received his Fire;\\nwhereupon _Maynard_ hoisted the King's Colours, and stood directly towards\\nhim, with the best Way that his Sails and Oars could made. _Black-beard_\\ncut his Cable, and endeavoured to make a running Fight, keeping a continual\\nFire at his Enemies, with his Guns; Mr. _Maynard_ not having any, kept a\\nconstant Fire with small Arms, while some of his Men laboured at their\\nOars. In a little Time _Teach_'s Sloop ran a-ground, and Mr. _Maynard_'s\\ndrawing more Water than that of the Pyrate, he could not come near him; so\\nhe anchored within half Gun-Shot of the Enemy, and, in order to lighten his\\nVessel, that he might run him aboard, the Lieutenant ordered all his\\nBallast to be thrown over-board, and all the Water to be staved, and then\\nweigh'd and stood for him; upon which _Black-beard_ hail'd him in this rude\\nManner: _Damn you for Villains, who are you? And, from whence came you?_\\nThe Lieutenant made him Answer, _You may see by our Colours we are no\\nPyrates._ _Black-beard_ bid him send his Boat on Board, that he might see\\nwho he was; but Mr. _Maynard_ reply'd thus; _I cannot spare my Boat, but I\\nwill come aboard of you as soon as I can, with my Sloop._ Upon this,\\n_Black-beard_ took a Glass of Liquor, and drank to him with these Words:\\n_Damnation seize my Soul if I give you Quarters, or take any from you._ In\\nAnswer to which, Mr. _Maynard_ told him, _That he expected no Quarters from\\nhim, nor should he give him any._\\n\\nBy this time _Black-beard_'s Sloop fleeted, as Mr. _Maynard_'s Sloops were\\nrowing towards him, which being not above a Foot high in the Waste, and\\nconsequently the Men all exposed, as they came near together, (there being\\nhitherto little or no Execution done, on either Side,) the Pyrate fired a\\nBroadside, charged with all Manner of small Shot. ----A fatal Stroke to\\nthem! The Sloop the Lieutenant was in, having twenty Men killed and\\nwounded, and the other Sloop nine. This could not be help'd, for there\\nbeing no Wind, they were oblig'd to keep to their Oars, otherwise the\\nPyrate would have got away from him, which, it seems, the Lieutenant was\\nresolute to prevent.\\n\\nAfter this unlucky Blow, _Black-beard_'s Sloop fell Broadside to the Shore;\\nMr. _Maynard_'s other Sloop, which was called the _Ranger_, fell a-stern,\\nbeing, for the present, disabled; so the Lieutenant finding his own Sloop\\nhad Way, and would soon be on Board of _Teach_, he ordered all his Men\\ndown, for fear of another Broadside, which must have been their\\nDestruction, and the loss of their Expedition. Mr. _Maynard_ was the only\\nPerson that kept the Deck, except the Man at the Helm, whom he directed to\\nlye down snug, and the Men in the Hold were ordered to get their Pistols\\nand their Swords ready for close fighting, and to come up at his Command;\\nin order to which, two Ladders were placed in the Hatch-Way for the more\\nExpedition. When the Lieutenant's Sloop boarded the other, Captain\\n_Teach_'s Men threw in several new fashioned sort of Grenadoes, _viz._ Case\\nBottles fill'd with Powder, and small Shot, Slugs, and Pieces of Lead or\\nIron, with a quick Match in the Mouth of it, which being lighted without\\nSide, presently runs into the Bottle to the Powder, and as it is instantly\\nthrown on Board, generally does great Execution, besides putting all the\\nCrew into a Confusion; but by good Providence, they had not that Effect\\nhere; the Men being in the Hold, and _Black-beard_ seeing few or no Hands\\naboard, told his Men, _That they were all knock'd on the Head, except three\\nor four; and therefore, says he, let's jump on Board, and cut them to\\nPieces._\\n\\nWhereupon, under the Smoak of one of the Bottles just mentioned,\\n_Black-beard_ enters with fourteen Men, over the Bows of _Maynard_'s Sloop,\\nand were not seen by him till the Air cleared; however, he just then gave a\\nSignal to his Men, who all rose in an Instant, and attack'd the Pyrates\\nwith as much Bravery as ever was done upon such an Occasion: _Black-beard_\\nand the Lieutenant fired the first Pistol at each other, by which the\\nPyrate received a Wound, and then engaged with Swords, till the\\nLieutenant's unluckily broke, and stepping back to cock a Pistol,\\n_Black-beard_, with his Cutlash, was striking at that Instant, that one of\\n_Maynard_'s Men gave him a terrible Wound in the Neck and Throat, by which\\nthe Lieutenant came off with a small Cut over his Fingers.\\n\\nThey were now closely and warmly engaged, the Lieutenant and twelve Men,\\nagainst _Black-beard_ and fourteen, till the Sea was tinctur'd with Blood\\nround the Vessel; _Black-beard_ received a Shot into his Body from the\\nPistol that Lieutenant _Maynard_ discharg'd, yet he stood his Ground, and\\nfought with great Fury, till he received five and twenty Wounds, and five\\nof them by Shot. At length, as he was cocking another Pistol, having fired\\nseveral before, he fell down dead; by which Time eight more out of the\\nfourteen dropp'd, and all the rest, much wounded, jump'd over-board, and\\ncall'd out for Quarters, which was granted, tho' it was only prolonging\\ntheir Lives for a few Days. The Sloop _Ranger_ came up, and attack'd the\\nMen that remain'd in _Black-beard_'s Sloop, with equal Bravery, till they\\nlikewise cry'd for Quarters.\\n\\nHere was an End of that couragious Brute, who might have pass'd in the\\nWorld for a Heroe, had he been employ'd in a good Cause; his Destruction,\\nwhich was of such Consequence to the Plantations, was entirely owing to the\\nConduct and Bravery of Lieutenant _Maynard_ and his Men, who might have\\ndestroy'd him with much less Loss, had they had a Vessel with great Guns;\\nbut they were obliged to use small Vessels, because the Holes and Places he\\nlurk'd in, would not admit of others of greater Draught; and it was no\\nsmall Difficulty for this Gentleman to get to him, having grounded his\\nVessel, at least, a hundred times, in getting up the River, besides other\\nDiscouragements, enough to have turn'd back any Gentleman without\\nDishonour, who was less resolute and bold than this Lieutenant. The\\nBroadside that did so much Mischief before they boarded, in all Probability\\nsaved the rest from Destruction; for before that _Teach_ had little or no\\nHopes of escaping, and therefore had posted a resolute Fellow, a Negroe\\nwhom he had bred up, with a lighted Match, in the Powder-Room, with\\nCommands to blow up when he should give him Orders, which was as soon as\\nthe Lieutenant and his Men could have entered, that so he might have\\ndestroy'd his Conquerors: and when the Negro found how it went with\\n_Black-beard_, he could hardly be perswaded from the rash Action, by two\\nPrisoners that were then in the Hold of the Sloop.\\n\\nWhat seems a little odd, is, that some of these Men, who behaved so bravely\\nagainst _Black-beard_, went afterwards a pyrating themselves, and one of\\nthem was taken along with _Roberts_; but I do not find that any of them\\nwere provided for, except one that was hanged; but this is a Digression.\\n\\nThe Lieutenant caused _Black-beard_'s Head to be severed from his Body, and\\nhung up at the Bolt-sprit End, then he sailed to _Bath-Town_, to get Relief\\nfor his wounded Men.\\n\\nIt must be observed, that in rummaging the Pyrate's Sloop, they found\\nseveral Letters and written Papers, which discovered the Correspondence\\nbetwixt Governor _Eden_, the Secretary and Collector, and also some Traders\\nat _New-York_, and _Black-beard_. It is likely he had Regard enough for his\\nFriends, to have destroyed these Papers before the Action, in order to\\nhinder them from falling into such Hands, where the Discovery would be of\\nno Use, either to the Interest or Reputation of these fine Gentlemen, if it\\nhad not been his fixed Resolution to have blown up together, when he found\\nno possibility of escaping.\\n\\nWhen the Lieutenant came to _Bath-Town_, he made bold to seize in the\\nGovernor's Store-House, the sixty Hogsheads of Sugar, and from honest Mr.\\n_Knight_, twenty; which it seems was their Dividend of the Plunder taken in\\nthe _French_ Ship; the latter did not long survive this shameful Discovery,\\nfor being apprehensive that he might be called to an Account for these\\nTrifles, fell sick with the Fright, and died in a few Days.\\n\\nAfter the wounded Men were pretty well recover'd, the Lieutenant sailed\\nback to the Men of War in _James River_, in _Virginia_, with\\n_Black-beard_'s Head still hanging at the Bolt-sprit End, and fiveteen\\nPrisoners, thirteen of whom were hanged. It appearing upon Tryal, that one\\nof them, _viz._ _Samuel Odell_, was taken out of the trading Sloop, but the\\nNight before the Engagement. This poor Fellow was a little unlucky at his\\nfirst entering upon his new Trade, there appearing no less than 70 Wounds\\nupon him after the Action, notwithstanding which, he lived, and was cured\\nof them all. The other Person that escaped the Gallows, was one _Israel\\nHands_, the Master of _Black-beard_'s Sloop, and formerly Captain of the\\nsame, before the _Queen Ann's Revenge_ was lost in _Topsail_ Inlet.\\n\\nThe aforesaid _Hands_ happened not to be in the Fight, but was taken\\nafterwards ashore at _Bath-Town_, having been sometime before disabled by\\n_Black-beard_, in one of his savage Humours, after the following\\nManner.--One Night drinking in his Cabin with _Hands_, the Pilot, and\\nanother Man; _Black-beard_ without any Provocation privately draws out a\\nsmall Pair of Pistols, and cocks them under the Table, which being\\nperceived by the Man, he withdrew and went upon Deck, leaving _Hands_, the\\nPilot, and the Captain together. When the Pistols were ready, he blew out\\nthe Candle, and crossing his Hands, discharged them at his Company;\\n_Hands_, the Master, was shot thro' the Knee, and lam'd for Life; the other\\nPistol did no Execution. --Being asked the meaning of this, he only\\nanswered, by damning them, that _if he did not now and then kill one of\\nthem, they would forget who he was._\\n\\n_Hands_ being taken, was try'd and condemned, but just as he was about to\\nbe executed, a Ship arrives at _Virginia_ with a Proclamation for\\nprolonging the Time of his Majesty's Pardon, to such of the Pyrates as\\nshould surrender by a limited Time therein expressed: Notwithstanding the\\nSentence, _Hands_ pleaded the Pardon, and was allowed the Benefit of it,\\nand is alive at this Time in London, begging his Bread.\\n\\nNow that we have given some Account of _Teach_'s Life and Actions, it will\\nnot be amiss, that we speak of his Beard, since it did not a little\\ncontribute towards making his Name so terrible in those Parts.\\n\\n_Plutarch_, and other grave Historians have taken Notice, that several\\ngreat Men amongst the _Romans_, took their Sir-Names from certain odd Marks\\nin their Countenances; as _Cicero_, from a Mark or Vetch on his Nose; so\\nour Heroe, Captain _Teach_, assumed the Cognomen of _Black-beard_, from\\nthat large Quantity of Hair, which, like a frightful Meteor, covered his\\nwhole Face, and frightened _America_ more than any Comet that has appeared\\nthere a long Time.\\n\\nThis Beard was black, which he suffered to grow of an extravagant Length;\\nas to Breadth, it came up to his Eyes; he was accustomed to twist it with\\nRibbons, in small Tails, after the Manner of our Ramilies Wiggs, and turn\\nthem about his Ears: In Time of Action, he wore a Sling over his Shoulders,\\nwith three brace of Pistols, hanging in Holsters like Bandaliers; and stuck\\nlighted Matches under his Hat, which appearing on each Side of his Face,\\nhis Eyes naturally looking fierce and wild, made him altogether such a\\nFigure, that Imagination cannot form an Idea of a Fury, from Hell, to look\\nmore frightful.\\n\\nIf he had the look of a Fury, his Humours and Passions were suitable to it;\\nwe shall relate two or three more of his Extravagancies, which we omitted\\nin the Body of his History, by which it will appear, to what a Pitch of\\nWickedness, human Nature may arrive, if it's Passions are not checked.\\n\\nIn the Commonwealth of Pyrates, he who goes the greatest Length of\\nWickedness, is looked upon with a kind of Envy amongst them, as a Person of\\na more extraordinary Gallantry, and is thereby entitled to be distinguished\\nby some Post, and if such a one has but Courage, he must certainly be a\\ngreat Man. The Hero of whom we are writing, was thoroughly accomplished\\nthis Way, and some of his Frolicks of Wickedness, were so extravagant, as\\nif he aimed at making his Men believe he was a Devil incarnate; for being\\none Day at Sea, and a little flushed with drink:--_Come_, says he, _let us\\nmake a Hell of our own, and try how long we can bear it_; accordingly he,\\nwith two or three others, went down into the Hold, and closing up all the\\nHatches, filled several Pots full of Brimstone, and other combustible\\nMatter, and set it on Fire, and so continued till they were almost\\nsuffocated, when some of the Men cried out for Air; at length he opened the\\nHatches, not a little pleased that he held out the longest.\\n\\nThe Night before he was killed, he set up and drank till the Morning, with\\nsome of his own Men, and the Master of a Merchant-Man, and having had\\nIntelligence of the two Sloops coming to attack him, as has been before\\nobserved; one of his Men asked him, in Case any thing should happen to him\\nin the Engagement with the Sloops, whether his Wife knew where he had\\nburied his Money? He answered, _That no Body but himself and the Devil,\\nknew where it was, and the longest Liver should take all._\\n\\nThose of his Crew who were taken alive, told a Story which may appear a\\nlittle incredible; however, we think it will not be fair to omit it, since\\nwe had it from their own Mouths. That once upon a Cruize, they found out\\nthat they had a Man on Board more than their Crew; such a one was seen\\nseveral Days amongst them, sometimes below, and sometimes upon Deck, yet no\\nMan in the Ship could give an Account who he was, or from whence he came;\\nbut that he disappeared little before they were cast away in their great\\nShip, but, it seems, they verily believed it was the Devil.\\n\\nOne would think these Things should induce them to reform their Lives, but\\nso many Reprobates together, encouraged and spirited one another up in\\ntheir Wickedness, to which a continual Course of drinking did not a little\\ncontribute; for in _Black-beard_'s Journal, which was taken, there were\\nseveral Memorandums of the following Nature, sound writ with his own\\nHand.-- _Such a Day, Rum all out:--Our Company somewhat sober:--A damn'd\\nConfusion amongst us!--Rogues a plotting;--great Talk of Separation.--So I\\nlook'd sharp for a Prize;--such a Day took one, with a great deal of Liquor\\non Board, so kept the Company hot, damned hot, then all Things went well\\nagain._\\n\\nThus it was these Wretches passed their Lives, with very little Pleasure or\\nSatisfaction, in the Possession of what they violently take away from\\nothers, and sure to pay for it at last, by an ignominious Death.\\n\\nThe Names of the Pyrates killed in the Engagement, are as follow.\\n\\n_Edward Teach_, Commander.\\n\\n_Phillip Morton_, Gunner.\\n\\n_Garrat Gibbens_, Boatswain.\\n\\n_Owen Roberts_, Carpenter.\\n\\n_Thomas Miller_, Quarter-Master.\\n\\n_John Husk_,\\n\\n_Joseph Curtice_,\\n\\n_Joseph Brooks_, (1)\\n\\n_Nath. Jackson_.\\n\\nAll the rest, except the two last, were wounded and afterwards\\nhanged in _Virginia_.\\n\\n_John Carnes, Joseph Philips,_\\n\\n_Joseph Brooks, _(2)_ James Robbins,_\\n\\n_James Blake, John Martin,_\\n\\n_John Gills, Edward Salter,_\\n\\n_Thomas Gates, Stephen Daniel,_\\n\\n_James White, Richard Greensail._\\n\\n_Richard Stiles, Israel Hands, _pardoned.\\n\\n_Cæsar, Samuel Odel_, acquited.\\n\\n                                * * *\\n\\nThere were in the Pyrate Sloops, and ashore in a Tent, near where the\\nSloops lay, 25 Hogsheads of Sugar, 11 Teirces, and 145 Bags of Cocoa, a\\nBarrel of Indigo, and a Bale of Cotton; which, with what was taken from the\\nGovernor and Secretary, and the Sale of the Sloop, came to 2500 _l._\\nbesides the Rewards paid by the Governor of _Virginia_, pursuant to his\\nProclamation; all which was divided among the Companies of the two Ships,\\n_Lime_ and _Pearl_, that lay in _James_ River; the brave Fellows that took\\nthem coming in for no more than their Dividend amongst the rest, and was\\npaid it within these three Months.\\n\\nCHAP. IV. OF Major _Stede Bonnet_, And his CREW.\\n\\nTHE Major was a Gentleman of good Reputation in the Island of\\n_Barbadoes_, was Master of a plentiful Fortune, and had the Advantage of a\\nliberal Education. He had the least Temptation of any Man to follow such a\\nCourse of Life, from the Condition of his Circumstances. It was very\\nsurprizing to every one, to hear of the Major's Enterprize, in the Island\\nwere he liv'd; and as he was generally esteem'd and honoured, before he\\nbroke out into open Acts of Pyracy, so he was afterwards rather pitty'd\\nthan condemned, by those that were acquainted with him, believing that this\\nHumour of going a pyrating, proceeded from a Disorder in his Mind, which\\nhad been but too visible in him, some Time before this wicked Undertaking;\\nand which is said to have been occasioned by some Discomforts he found in a\\nmarried State; be that as it will, the Major was but ill qualify'd for the\\nBusiness, as not understanding maritime Affairs.\\n\\nHowever, he fitted out a Sloop with ten Guns and 70 Men, entirely at his\\nown Expence, and in the Night-Time sailed from _Barbadoes_. He called his\\nSloop the _Revenge_; his first Cruize was off the Capes of _Virginia_,\\nwhere he took several Ships, and plundered them of their Provisions,\\nCloaths, Money, Ammunition, _&c._ in particular the _Anne_, Captain\\n_Montgomery_, from _Glascow_; the _Turbet_ from _Barbadoes_, which for\\nCountry sake, after they had taken out the principal Part of the Lading,\\nthe Pyrate Crew set her on Fire; the _Endeavour_, Captain _Scot_, from\\n_Bristol_, and the _Young_ from _Leith_. From hence they went to\\n_New-York_, and off the East End of _Long-Island_, took a Sloop bound for\\nthe _West-Indies_, after which they stood in and landed some Men at\\n_Gardner_'s _Island_, but in a peaceable Manner, and bought Provisions for\\nthe Company's Use, which they paid for, and so went off again without\\nMolestation.\\n\\nSome Time after, which was in _August_ 1717, _Bonnet_ came off the Bar of\\n_South-Carolina_, and took a Sloop and a Brigantine bound in; the Sloop\\nbelonged to _Barbadoes, Joseph Palmer_ Master, laden with Rum, Sugar and\\nNegroes; and the Brigantine came from _New-England, Thomas Porter_ Master,\\nwhom they plundered, and then dismiss'd; but they sailed away with the\\nSloop, and at an Inlet in _North-Carolina_ careened by her, and then set\\nher on Fire.\\n\\nAfter the Sloop had cleaned, they put to Sea, but came to no Resolution\\nwhat Course to take; the Crew were divided in their Opinions, some being\\nfor one Thing, and some another, so that nothing but Confusion seem'd to\\nattend all their Schemes.\\n\\nThe Major was no Sailor as was said before, and therefore had been obliged\\nto yield to many Things that were imposed on him, during their Undertaking,\\nfor want of a competent Knowledge in maritime Affairs; at length happening\\nto fall in Company with another Pyrate, one _Edward Teach_, (who for his\\nremarkable black ugly Beard, was more commonly called _Black-Beard_:) This\\nFellow was a good Sailor, but a most cruel hardened Villain, bold and\\ndaring to the last Degree, and would not stick at the perpetrating the most\\nabominable Wickedness imaginable; for which he was made Chief of that\\nexecrable Gang, that it might be said that his Post was not unduly filled,\\n_Black-beard_ being truly the Superior in Roguery, of all the Company, as\\nhas been already related.\\n\\nTo him _Bonnet_'s Crew joined in Consortship, and _Bonnet_ himself was laid\\naside, notwithstanding the Sloop was his own; he went aboard\\n_Black-beard_'s Ship, not concerning himself with any of their Affairs,\\nwhere he continued till she was lost in _Topsail_ Inlet, and one _Richards_\\nwas appointed Captain in his Room. The Major now saw his Folly, but could\\nnot help himself, which made him Melancholy; he reflected upon his past\\nCourse of Life, and was confounded with Shame, when he thought upon what he\\nhad done: His Behaviour was taken Notice of by the other Pyrates, who liked\\nhim never the better for it; and he often declared to some of them, that he\\nwould gladly leave off that Way of Living, being fully tired of it; but he\\nshould be ashamed to see the Face of any _English_ Man again; therefore if\\nhe could get to _Spain_ or _Portugal_, where he might be undiscovered, he\\nwould spend the Remainder of his Days in either of those Countries,\\notherwise he must continue with them as long as he lived.\\n\\nWhen _Black-beard_ lost his Ship at _Topsail_ Inlet, and surrendered to the\\nKing's Proclamation, _Bonnet_ reassumed the Command of his own Sloop,\\n_Revenge_, goes directly away to _Bath-Town_ in _North-Carolina_,\\nsurrenders likewise to the King's Pardon, and receives a Certificate. The\\nWar was now broke out between the _Tripple_ Allies and _Spain_; so Major\\n_Bonnet_ gets a Clearence for his Sloop at _North-Carlina_, to go to the\\nIsland of St. _Thomas_, with a Design (at least it was pretended so) to get\\nthe Emperor's Commission, to go a Privateering upon the _Spaniards_. When\\n_Bonnet_ came back to _Topsail_ Inlet, he found that _Teach_ and his Gang\\nwere gone, and that they had taken all the Money, small Arms and Effects of\\nValue out of the great Ship, and set ashore on a small sandy Island above a\\nLeague from the Main, seventeen Men, no doubt with a Design they should\\nperish, there being no Inhabitant, or Provisions to subsist withal, nor any\\nBoat or Materials to build or make any kind of Launch or Vessel, to escape\\nfrom that desolate Place: They remained there two Nights and one Day,\\nwithout Subsistance, or the least Prospect of any, expecting nothing else\\nbut a lingering Death; when to their inexpressable Comfort, they saw\\nRedemption at Hand; for Major _Bonnet_ happening to get Intelligence of\\ntheir being there, by two of the Pyrates who had escaped _Teach_'s Cruelty,\\nand had got to a poor little Village at the upper End of the Harbour, sent\\nhis Boat to make Discovery of the Truth of the Matter, which the poor\\nWretches seeing, made a signal to them, and they were all brought on Board\\n_Bonnet_'s Sloop.\\n\\nMajor _Bonnet_ told all his Company, that he would take a Commission to go\\nagainst the _Spaniards_, and to that End, was going to St. _Thomas_'s\\ntherefore if they would go with him, they should be welcome; whereupon they\\nall consented, but as the Sloop was preparing to sail, a Bom-Boat, that\\nbrought Apples and Sider to sell to the Sloop's Men, informed them, that\\nCaptain _Teach_ lay at _Ocricock_ Inlet, with only 18 or 20 Hands.\\n_Bonnet_, who bore him a mortal Hatred for some Insults offered him, went\\nimmediately in pursuit of _Black-beard_, but it happened too late, for he\\nmissed of him there, and after four Days Cruize, hearing no farther News of\\nhim, they steered their Course towards _Virginia_.\\n\\nIn the Month of _July_, these Adventurers came off the Capes, and meeting\\nwith a Pink with a Stock of Provisions on Board, which they happened to be\\nin Want of, they took out of her ten or twelve Barrels of Pork, and about\\n400 Weight of Bread; but because they would not have this set down to the\\nAccount of Pyracy, they gave them eight or ten Casks of Rice, and an old\\nCable, in lieu thereof.\\n\\nTwo Days afterwards they chased a Sloop of sixty Ton, and took her two\\nLeagues off of Cape _Henry_; they were so happy here as to get a Supply of\\nLiquor to their Victuals, for they brought from her two Hogsheads of Rum,\\nand as many of Molosses, which, it seems, they had need of, tho' they had\\nnot ready Money to purchase them: What Security they intended to give, I\\ncan't tell, but _Bonnet_ sent eight Men to take Care of the Prize Sloop,\\nwho, perhaps, not caring to make Use of those accustom'd Freedoms, took the\\nfirst Opportunity to go off with her, and _Bonnet_ (who was pleased to have\\nhimself called Captain _Thomas_,) saw them no more.\\n\\nAfter this, the Major threw off all Restraint, and though he had just\\nbefore received his Majesty's Mercy, in the Name of _Stede Bonnet_, he\\nrelaps'd in good Earnest into his old Vocation, by the Name of Captain\\n_Thomas_, and recommenced a down-right Pyrate, by taking and plundering all\\nthe Vessels he met with: He took off Cape _Henry_, two Ships from\\n_Virginia_, bound to _Glascow_, out of which they had very little besides\\nan hundred Weight of Tobacco. The next Day they took a small Sloop bound\\nfrom _Virginia_ to _Bermudas_, which supply'd them with twenty Barrels of\\nPork, some Bacon, and they gave her in return, two Barrels of Rice, and a\\nHogshead of Molossus; out of this Sloop two Men enter'd voluntarily. The\\nnext they took was another _Virginia_ Man, bound to _Glascow_, out of which\\nthey had nothing of Value, save only a few Combs, Pins and Needles, and\\ngave her instead thereof, a Barrel of Pork, and two Barrels of Bread.\\n\\nFrom _Virginia_ they sailed to _Philadelphia_, and in the Latitude of 38\\nNorth, they took a Scooner, coming from _North-Carolina_, bound to\\n_Boston_, they had out of her only two Dozen of Calf-Skins, to make Covers\\nfor Guns, and two of their Hands, and detained her some Days. All this was\\nbut small Game, and seem'd as if they design'd only to make Provision for\\ntheir Sloop against they arrived at St. _Thomas_'s; for they hitherto had\\ndealt favourably with all that were so unhappy as so fall into their Hands;\\nbut those that came after, fared not so well, for in the Latitude of 32,\\noff of _Delaware_ River, near _Philadelphia_, they took two Snows bound to\\n_Bristol_, out of whom they got some Money, besides Goods, perhaps to the\\nValue of 150 Pounds; at the same Time they took a Sloop of sixty Tons bound\\nfrom _Philadelphia_ to _Barbadoes_, which after taking some Goods out, they\\ndismissed along with the Snows.\\n\\nThe 29th Day of _July_, Captain _Thomas_ took a Sloop of 50 Tons, six or\\nseven Leagues off _Delaware_ Bay, bound from _Philadelphia_ to _Barbadoes,\\nThomas Read_ Master, loaden with Provisions, which they kept, and put four\\nor five of their Hands on Board her. The last Day of _July_, they took\\nanother Sloop of 60 Tons, commanded by _Peter Manwaring_, bound from\\n_Antegoa_ to _Philadelphia_, which they likewise kept with all the Cargo,\\nconsisting chiefly of Rum, Molosses, Sugar, Cotton, Indigo, and about 25\\nPound in Money, valued in all to 500 Pound.\\n\\nThe last Day of _July_, our Rovers with the Vessels last taken, left\\n_Delaware_ Bay, and sailed to Cape _Fear_ River, where they staid too long\\nfor their Safety, for the Pyrate Sloop which they now new named the _Royal\\nJames_, proved very leaky, so that they were obliged to remain here almost\\ntwo Months, to refit and repair their Vessel: They took in this River a\\nsmall Shallop, which they ripped up to mend the Sloop, and retarded the\\nfurther Prosecution of their Voyage, as before mentioned, till the News\\ncame to _Carolina_, of a Pyrate Sloop's being there to carreen with her\\nPrizes.\\n\\nUpon this Information, the Council of _South-Carolina_ was alarmed, and\\napprehended they should receive another Visit from them speedily; to\\nprevent which, Colonel _William Rhet_, of the same Province, waited on the\\nGovernor, and generously offered himself to go with two Sloops to attack\\nthis Pyrate; which the Governor readily accepted, and accordingly gave the\\nColonel a Commission and full Power, to fit such Vessels as he thought\\nproper for the Design.\\n\\nIn a few Days two Sloops were equipped and manned: The _Henry_ with 8 Guns\\nand 70 Men, commanded by Captain _John Masters_, and the _Sea Nymph_, with\\n8 Guns and 60 Men, commanded by Captain _Fayrer Hall_, both under the\\nentire Direction and Command of the aforesaid Colonel _Rhet_, who, on the\\n14th of _September_, went on Board the _Henry_, and, with the other Sloop,\\nsailed from _Charles-Town_ to _Swillivants_ Island, to put themselves in\\norder for the Cruize. Just then arrived a small Ship from _Antigoa_, one\\n_Cock_ Master, with an Account, that in Sight of the Bar he was taken and\\nplundered by one _Charles Vane_, a Pyrate, in a Brigantine of 12 Guns and\\n90 Men; and who had also taken two other Vessels bound in there, one a\\nsmall Sloop, Captain _Dill_ Master, from _Barbadoes_; the other a\\nBrigantine, Captain _Thompson_ Master, from _Guiney_, with ninety odd\\nNegroes, which they took out of the Vessel, and put on Board another Sloop\\nthen under the Command of one _Yeats_, his Consort, with 25 Men. This\\nprov'd fortunate to the Owners of the _Guiney_ Man, for _Yeats_ having\\noften attempted to quit this Course of Life, took an Opportunity in the\\nNight, to leave _Vane_ and to run into _North-Edisto_ River, to the\\nSouthward of _Charles-Town_, and surrendered to his Majesty's Pardon. The\\nOwners got their Negroes, and _Yeats_ and his Men had Certificates given\\nthem from the Government.\\n\\n_Vane_ cruised some Time off the Bar, in hopes to catch _Yeats_, and\\nunfortunately for them, took two Ships coming out, bound to _London_, and\\nwhile the Prisoners were aboard, some of the Pyrates gave out, that they\\ndesigned to go into one of the Rivers to the Southward. Colonel _Rhet_,\\nupon hearing this, sailed over the Bar the 15th of _September_, with the\\ntwo Sloops before mentioned; and having the Wind Northerly, went after the\\nPyrate _Vane_, and scoured the Rivers and Inlets to the Southward; but not\\nmeeting with him, tacked and stood for Cape _Fear_ River, in Prosecution of\\nhis first Design. On the 26th following, in the Evening, the Colonel with\\nhis small Squadron, entered the River, and saw, over a Point of Land, three\\nSloops at an Anchor, which were Major _Bonnet_ and his Prizes; but it\\nhappened that in going up the River, the Pilot run the Colonel's Sloops\\naground, and it was dark before they were on Float, which hindered their\\ngetting up that Night. The Pyrates soon discovered the Sloops, but not\\nknowing who they were, or upon what Design they came into that River, they\\nmanned three Canoes, and sent them down to take them, but they quickly\\nfound their Mistake, and returned to the Sloop, with the unwelcome News.\\nMajor _Bonnet_ made Preparations that Night for engaging, and took all the\\nMen out of the Prizes. He shewed Captain _Manwaring_, one of his Prisoners,\\na Letter, he had just wrote, which he declared he would send to the\\nGovernor of _Carolina_; the Letter was to this Effect, _viz. That if the\\nSloops, which then appeared, were sent out against him, by the said\\nGovernor, and he should get clear off, that he would burn and destroy all\\nShips or Vessels going in or coming out of_ South-Carolina. The next\\nMorning they got under Sail, and came down the River, designing only a\\nrunning Fight. Colonel _Rhet_'s Sloops got likewise under Sail, and stood\\nfor him, getting upon each Quarter of the Pyrate, with Intent to board him;\\nwhich he perceiving, edged in towards the Shore, and being warmly engaged,\\ntheir Sloop ran a-ground: The _Carolina_ Sloops being in the same shoal\\nWater, were in the same Circumstances; the _Henry_, in which Colonel _Rhet_\\nwas, grounded within Pistol shot of the Pyrate, and on his Bow; the other\\nSloop grounded right a-head of him, and almost out of Gun-Shot, which made\\nher of little Service to the Colonel, while they lay a-ground.\\n\\nAt this Time the Pyrate had a considerable Advantage; for their Sloop,\\nafter she was a-ground, listed from Colonel _Rhet_'s, by which Means they\\nwere all covered, and the Colonel's Sloop listing the same Way, his Men\\nwere much exposed; notwithstanding which, they kept a brisk Fire the whole\\nTime they lay thus a-ground, which was near five Hours. The Pyrates made a\\nWiff in their bloody Flag, and beckoned several Times with their Hats in\\nDerision to the Colonel's Men, to come on Board, which they answered with\\nchearful Huzza's, and said, _that they would speak with them by and by_;\\nwhich accordingly happened, for the Colonel's Sloop being first a float, he\\ngot into deeper Water, and after mending the Sloop's Rigging, which was\\nmuch shattered in the Engagement, they stood for the Pyrate, to give the\\nfinishing Stroke, and designed to go directly on Board him; which he\\nprevented, by sending a Flag of Truce, and after some Time capitulating,\\nthey surrendered themselves Prisoners. The Colonel took Possession of the\\nSloop, and was extreamly pleased to find that Captain _Thomas_, who\\ncommanded her, was the individual Person of Major _Stede Bonnet_, who had\\ndone them the Honour several Times to visit their own Coast of _Carolina_.\\n\\nThere were killed in this Action, on Board the _Henry_, ten Men, and\\nfourteen wounded; on Board the _Sea Nymph_, two killed and four wounded.\\nThe Officers and Sailors in both Sloops behaved themselves with the\\ngreatest Bravery; and had not the Sloops so unluckily run a-ground, they\\nhad taken the Pyrate with much less loss of Men; but as he designed to get\\nby them, and so make a running Fight, the _Carolina_ Sloops were obliged to\\nkeep near him, to prevent his getting away. Of the Pyrates there were seven\\nkilled and five wounded, two of which died soon after of their Wounds.\\nColonel _Rhet_ weigh'd the 30th of _September_, from Cape _Fear_ River, and\\narrived at _Charles-Town_ the 3d of _October_, to the great Joy of the\\nwhole Province of _Carolina_.\\n\\n_Bonnet_ and his Crew, two Days after, were put ashore, and there not being\\na publick Prison, the Pyrates were kept at the Watch-House, under a Guard\\nof Militia; but Major _Bonnet_ was committed into the Custody of the\\nMarshal, at his House; and in a few Days after, _David Hariot_ the Master,\\nand _Ignatius Pell_ the Boatswain, who were designed for Evidences against\\nthe other Pyrates, were removed from the rest of the Crew, to the said\\nMarshal's House, and every Night two Centinals set about the said House;\\nbut whether thro' any Corruption, or want of Care in guarding the\\nPrisoners, I can't say; but on the 24th of _October_, the Major and\\n_Hariot_ made their Escape, the Boatswain refusing to go along with them.\\nThis made a great Noise in the Province, and People were open in their\\nResentments, often reflecting on the Governor, and others in the\\nMagistracy, as tho' they had been brib'd, for conniving at their Escape.\\nThese Invectives arose from their Fears, that _Bonnet_ would be capable of\\nraising another Company, and prosecute his Revenge against this Country,\\nfor what he had lately, tho' justly, suffered: But they were in a short\\nTime made easy in those Respects; for as soon as the Governor had the\\nAccount of _Bonnet_'s Escape, he immediately issued out a Proclamation, and\\npromised a Reward of 700 Pounds to any that would take him, and sent\\nseveral Boats with armed Men, both to the Northward and Southward, in\\npursuit of him.\\n\\n_Bonnet_ stood to the Northward, in a small Vessel, but wanting\\nNecessaries, and the Weather being bad, he was forced back, and so return'd\\nwith his Canoe, to _Swillivants_ Island, near _Charles-Town_, to fetch\\nSupplies; but there being some Information sent to the Governor, he sent\\nfor Colonel _Rhet_, and desired him to go in pursuit of _Bonnet_; and\\naccordingly gave him a Commission for that Purpose: Wherefore the Colonel,\\nwith proper Craft, and some Men, went away that Night for _Swillivant_'s\\nIsland, and, after a very diligent Search, discovered _Bonnet_ and _Hariot_\\ntogether; the Colonel's Men fired upon them, and killed _Hariot_ upon the\\nSpot, and wounded one Negro and an _Indian. Bonnet_ submitted, and\\nsurrender'd himself; and the next Morning, being _November_ the 6th, was\\nbrought by Colonel _Rhet_ to _Charles-Town_, and, by the Governor's\\nWarrant, was committed into safe Custody, in order for his being brought to\\nhis Tryal.\\n\\nOn the 28th of _October_, 1718, a Court of Vice-Admiralty was held at\\n_Charles-Town_, in _South-Carolina_, and, by several Adjournments,\\ncontinued to _Wednesday_, the 12th of _November_ following, for the Tryal\\nof the Pyrates taken in a Sloop formerly called _the Revenge_, but\\nafterwards _the Royal James_, before _Nicholas Trot_, Esq; Judge of the\\nVice-Admiralty, and Chief Justice of the said Province of _South-Carolina_,\\nand other Assistant Judges.\\n\\nThe King's Commission to Judge _Trot_ was read, and a Grand Jury sworn, for\\nthe finding of the several Bills, and a learned Charge given them by the\\nsaid Judge, wherein he 1st shewed, _That the Sea was given by God, for the\\nUse of Men, and is Subject to Dominion and Property, as well as the Land_.\\n\\n2dly, He particularly remark'd to them, _the Sovereignty of the King of_\\nEngland _over the_ British _Seas_.\\n\\n3dly, He observed, _that as Commerce and Navigation could not be carried on\\nwithout Laws; so there have been always particular Laws, for the better\\nordering and regulating marine Affairs_; with an historical Account or\\nthose Laws, and Origine.\\n\\n4thly, He proceeded to shew, _that there have been particular Courts and\\nJudges appointed; to whose Jurisdiction maritime Causes do belong, and that\\nin Matters both Civil and Criminal_.\\n\\nAnd then 5thly, He particularly shewed them, _the Constitution and\\nJurisdiction of that Court of Admiralty Sessions_.\\n\\nAnd lastly, _the Crimes cognizable therein_; and particularly enlarged\\n_upon the Crime of Pyracy_, which was then brought before them.\\n\\nThe Indictments being found, a petit Jury was sworn, and the following\\nPersons arraigned and tried.\\n\\n                                * * *\\n\\n_Stede Bonnet_, alias _Edwards_, alias _Thomas_, late of _Barbadoes_,\\nMariner.\\n\\n_Robert Tucker_, late of the Island of _Jamaica_, Mariner.\\n\\n_Edward Robinson_, late of _New-Castle_ upon _Tine_, Mariner.\\n\\n_Neal Paterson_, late of _Aberdeen_, Mariner.\\n\\n_William Scot_, late of _Aberdeen_, Mariner.\\n\\n_William Eddy_, alias _Neddy_, late of _Aberdeen_, Mariner.\\n\\n_Alexander Annand_, late of _Jamaica_, Mariner.\\n\\n_George Rose_, late of _Glascow_, Mariner.\\n\\n_George Dunkin_, late of _Glascow_, Mariner.\\n\\n*_Thomas Nicholas_, late of _London_, Mariner.\\n\\n_John Ridge_, late of _London_, Mariner.\\n\\n_Matthew King_, late of _Jamaica_, Mariner.\\n\\n_Daniel Perry_, late of _Guernsey_, Mariner.\\n\\n_Henry Virgin_, late of _Bristol_, Mariner.\\n\\n_James Robbins_, alias _Rattle_, late of _London_, Mariner.\\n\\n_James Mullet_, alias _Millet_, late of _London_, Mariner.\\n\\n_Thomas Price_, late of _Bristol_, Mariner.\\n\\n_James Wilson_, late of _Dublin_, Mariner.\\n\\n_John Lopez_, late of _Oporto_, Mariner.\\n\\n_Zachariah Long_, late of the Province of _Holland_, Mariner.\\n\\n_Job Bayly_, late of _London_, Mariner.\\n\\n_John-William Smith_, late of _Charles-Town, Carolina_, Mariner.\\n\\n_Thomas Carman_, late of _Maidstone_ in _Kent_, Mariner.\\n\\n_John Thomas_, late of _Jamaica_, Mariner.\\n\\n_William Morrison_, late of _Jamaica_, Mariner.\\n\\n_Samuel Booth_, late of _Charles-Town_, Mariner.\\n\\n_William Hewet_, late of _Jamaica_, Mariner.\\n\\n_John Levit_, late of _North-Carolina_, Mariner.\\n\\n_William Livers_, alias _Evis_.\\n\\n_John Brierly_, alias _Timberhead_, late of _Bath-Town_ in _North\\nCarolina_, Mariner.\\n\\n_Robert Boyd_, late of _Bath-Town_ aforesaid, Mariner.\\n\\n*_Rowland Sharp_, of _Bath-Town_, Mariner.\\n\\n*_Jonathan Clarke_, late of _Charles-Town, South Carolina_, Mariner.\\n\\n*_Thomas Gerrard_, late of _Antegoa_, Mariner.\\n\\n                                * * *\\n\\nAnd all, except the three last, and _Thomas Nicholas_, were found Guilty,\\nand received Sentence of Death.\\n\\nThey were most of them try'd upon two Indictments, as follows.\\n\\n                                * * *\\n\\nT_HE Jurors for our Sovereign Lord the King, do upon their Oath\\npresent, that_ Stede Bonnet, _late of_ Barbadoes, _Mariner_, Robert Tucker,\\n&c. &c. _The_ 2_d Day of_ August, _in the fifth Year of the Reign of our\\nSovereign Lord_ George, &c. _By Force of Arms upon the High-Sea, in a\\ncertain Place called Cape_ James, &c. _did pyratically, and felloniously\\nset upon, break,_ _board, and enter, a certain Merchant Sloop, called the_\\nFrances, Peter Manwaring _Commander, by Force_, &c. _upon the High-Sea, in\\na certain Place, called Cape_ James, alias _Cape_ Inlopen, _about two Miles\\ndistant from the Shore, in the Lattitude of_ 39, _or thereabouts; and\\nwithin the Jurisdiction of the Court of Vice-Admiralty, of_ South-Carolina,\\n_being a Sloop of certain Persons_, (_to the Jurors, unknown_) _and then,\\nand there, pyratically, and felloniously did make an Assault, in, and upon\\nthe said_ Peter Manwaring, _and others his Mariners_, (_whose Names to the\\nJurors aforesaid, are unknown,) in the same Sloop, against the Peace of\\nGod, and of our said now Sovereign Lord the King, then, and there being,\\npyratically and felloniously, did put the aforesaid_ Peter Manwaring, _and\\nothers, his Mariners, of the same Sloop, in the Sloop aforesaid, then\\nbeing, in corporal Fear of their Lives, then and there, in the Sloop\\naforesaid, upon the_ High-Sea, _in the Place aforesaid, called Cape_ James,\\nalias _Cape_ Inlopen, _about two Miles from the Shore, in the Lattitude of_\\n39, _or thereabouts, as aforesaid, and within the Jurisdiction aforesaid;\\npyratically, and felloniously, did steal, take, and carry away the said\\nMerchant Sloop, called the_ Frances, _and also twenty six Hogsheads_, &c.\\n&c. &c. _being found in the aforesaid Sloop, in the Custody and Possession\\nof the said_ Peter Manwaring, _and others, his Mariners of the said Sloop,\\nand from their Custody and Possession, then and there, upon the High-Sea\\naforesaid, called Cape_ James, alias _Cape_ Inlopen, _as aforesaid, and\\nwithin the Jurisdiction aforesaid, against the Peace of our now Sovereign\\nLord the King, his Crown and Dignity_.\\n\\nThis was the Form of the Indictments they were arraigned upon, and tho'\\nthey might have proved several more Facts upon the major Part of the Crew,\\nthe Court thought fit to prosecute but two; the other was for seizing in a\\npyratical and felonious Manner, the Sloop _Fortune, Thomas Read_ Commander;\\nwhich Indictment running in the same Form with the above-mentioned, it will\\nbe unnecessary to say more of it.\\n\\nAll the Prisoners arraigned, pleaded Not Guilty, and put themselves upon\\ntheir Tryals, except _James Wilson_, and _John Levit_, who pleaded Guilty\\nto both Indictments, and _Daniel Perry_, to one only. The Major would have\\ngone through both the Indictments at once, which the Court not admitting,\\nhe pleaded Not Guilty to both Indictments, but being convicted of one, he\\nretracted his former Plea to the second Indictment, and pleaded Guilty to\\nit.\\n\\nThe Prisoners made little or no Defence, every one pretending only that\\nthey were taken off a Maroon Shore, and were shipped with Major _Bonnet_ to\\ngo to St. _Thomas_'s; but being out at Sea, and wanting Provisions, they\\nwere obliged to do what they did by others; and so did Major _Bonnet_\\nhimself, pretend that 'twas Force, not Inclination, that occasioned what\\nhad happened. However, the Facts being plainly proved, and that they had\\nall shared ten or eleven Pounds a Man, excepting the three last, and\\n_Thomas Nichols_, they were all but they, found Guilty. The Judge made a\\nvery grave Speech to them, setting forth _the Enormity of their Crimes, the\\nCondition they were now in, and the Nature and Necessity of an unfeigned\\nRepentance_; and then recommended them to the Ministers of the Province,\\nfor more ample Directions, to fit them for Eternity, _for_ (concluded he)\\n_the Priest's Lips shall keep Knowledge, and you shall seek the Law at\\ntheir Mouths; for they are the Messengers of the Lord_.

And then pronounced\\nSentence of Death upon them.\\n\\nOn _Saturday November_ the 8th, 1711. _Robert Tucker, Edward Robinson, Neal\\nPaterson, William Scot, Job Bayley, John-William Smith, John Thomas,\\nWilliam Morrison, Samuel Booth, William Hewit, William Eddy_, alias _Neddy,\\nAlexander Annand, George Ross, George Dunkin, Matthew King, Daniel Perry,\\nHenry Virgin, James Robbins, James Mullet_, alias _Millet, Thomas Price,\\nJohn Lopez_, and _Zachariah Long_, were executed at the _White-Point_ near\\n_Charles-Town_, pursuant to their Sentence.\\n\\nAs for the Captain, his Escape protracted his Fate, and spun out his Life a\\nfew Days longer, for he was try'd the 10th, and being found Guilty,\\nreceived Sentence in like Manner as the former; before which Judge _Trot_,\\nmade a most excellent Speech to him, rather somewhat too long to be taken\\ninto our History, yet I could not tell how to pass by so good and useful a\\nPiece of Instruction, not knowing whose Hands this Book may happen to fall\\ninto.\\n\\n_The Lord Chief Justices's_ SPEECH, _upon his pronouncing Sentence on\\nMajor_ STEDE BONNET.\\n\\nMAjor _Stede Bonnet_, you stand here convicted upon two Indictments\\nof Pyracy; one by the Verdict of the Jury, and the other by your own\\nConfession.\\n\\nAltho' you were indicted but for _two_ Facts, yet you know that at your\\nTryal it was fully proved even by an unwilling Witness, that you\\n_pyratically_ took and rifled no less than _thirteen_ Vessels, since you\\nsail'd from _North-Carolina_.\\n\\nSo that you might have been indicted, and convicted of _eleven_ more Acts\\nof _Pyracy_, since you took the Benefit of the King's _Act of Grace_, and\\npretended to leave that wicked Course of Life.\\n\\nNot to mention the many _Acts_ of _Pyracy_ you committed before; for which\\nif your Pardon from _Man_ was never so authentick, yet you must expect to\\nanswer for them before God.\\n\\nYou know that the Crimes you have committed are _evil_ in themselves, and\\ncontrary to the _Light_ and _Law_ of _Nature_, as well as the _Law_ of God,\\nby which you are commanded that _you shall not steal_, Exod. 20. 15. And\\nthe Apostle St. _Paul_ expresly affirms, That _Thieves shall not inherit\\nthe Kingdom of God_, 1 Cor. 6. 10.\\n\\nBut to _Theft_ you have added a greater Sin, which is _Murder_. How many\\nyou may have _killed_ of those that resisted you in the committing your\\nformer _Pyracies_, I know not: But this we all know, That besides the\\nWounded, you kill'd no less than _eighteen_ Persons out of those that were\\nsent by lawful Authority to suppress you, and put a Stop to those Rapines\\nthat you daily acted.\\n\\nAnd however you may fancy that that was killing Men fairly in open _Fight_,\\nyet this know, that the Power of the _Sword_ not being committed into your\\nHands by any lawful Authority, you were not impowered to use any _Force_,\\nor _fight_ any one; and therefore those Persons that fell in that Action,\\nin doing their Duty to their King and Country, were _murdered_, and their\\n_Blood_ now cries out for _Vengeance_ and _Justice_ against you: For it is\\nthe _Voice of Nature_, confirmed by the _Law_ of God, That _whosoever\\nsheddeth Man's Blood, by Man shall his Blood be shed_. Gen. 9. 6.\\n\\nAnd consider that Death is not the only Punishment due to _Murderers_; for\\nthey are threatened to have _their Part in the Lake which burneth with Fire\\nand Brimstone, which is the second Death_, Rev. 21. 8. See _Chap._ 22. 15.\\nWords which carry that Terror with them, that considering your\\nCircumstances and your Guilt, surely the Sound of them must make you\\ntremble; _For who can dwell with everlasting Burnings?_ Chap. 33. 14.\\n\\nAs the _Testimony_ of your _Conscience_ must convince you of the great and\\nmany Evils you have committed, by which you have highly offended God, and\\nprovoked most justly his Wrath and Indignation against you, so I suppose I\\nneed not tell you that the only Way of obtaining Pardon and Remission of\\nyour Sins from God, is by a true and unfeigned _Repentance_ and _Faith_ in\\nChrist, by whose meritorious Death and Passion, you can only hope for\\nSalvation.\\n\\nYou being a Gentleman that have had the Advantage of a _liberal Education_,\\nand being generally esteemed a Man of _Letters_, I believe it will be\\nneedless for me to explain to you the Nature of _Repentance_ and _Faith_ in\\nChrist, they being so fully and so often mentioned in the Scriptures, that\\nyou cannot but know them. And therefore, perhaps, for that Reason it might\\nbe thought by some improper for me to have said so much to you, as I have\\nalready upon this Occasion; neither should I have done it, but that\\nconsidering the Course of your Life and Actions, I have just Reason to\\nfear, that the Principles of Religion that had been instilled into you by\\nyour _Education_, have been at least corrupted, if not entirely defaced, by\\nthe _Scepticism_ and _Infidelity_ of this wicked Age; and that what Time\\nyou allowed for Study, was rather applied to the _Polite Literature_, and\\nthe vain _Philosophy_ of the Times, than a serious Search after the _Law_\\nand _Will_ of God, as revealed unto us in the Holy _Scriptures_: For _had\\nyour Delight been in the Law of the Lord, and that you had meditated\\ntherein Day and Night_, Psal. 1. 2. you would then have found that God's\\n_Word was a Lamp unto your Feet, and a Light to your Path_, Psal. 119. 105.\\nand that you would account all other Knowledge but _Loss_, in Comparison of\\n_the Excellency of the Knowledge of Christ Jesus_, Phil. 3. 8. _who to them\\nthat are called is the Power of God, and the Wisdom of God_, 1 Cor. 1. 24.\\n_even the hidden Wisdom which God ordained before the World_, Chap. 2. 7.\\n\\nYou would then have esteemed the _Scriptures_ as the _Great Charter_ of\\nHeaven, and which delivered to us not only the most perfect _Laws_ and\\n_Rules_ of Life, but also discovered to us the Acts of _Pardon_ from God,\\nwherein they have offended those righteous Laws: For in them only is to be\\nfound the great _Mystery_ of fallen Man's _Redemption, which the Angels\\ndesire to look into_, 1 Pet. 1. 12.\\n\\nAnd they would have taught you that _Sin_ is the debasing of _Human\\nNature_, as being a _Derivation_ from that _Purity, Rectitude_, and\\n_Holiness_, in which God created us, and that _Virtue_ and _Religion_, and\\nwalking by the Laws of God, were altogether preferable to the Ways of _Sin_\\nand _Satan_; for that the _Ways_ of Virtue are _Ways of Pleasantness, and\\nall their Paths are Peace_, Prov. 3. 17.\\n\\nBut what you could not learn from God's Word, by reason of your\\n_carelesly_, or but _superficially_ considering the same, I hope the Course\\nof his _Providence_, and the present _Afflictions_ that he hath laid upon\\nyou, hath now convinced you of the same: For however in your seeming\\nProsperity you might make a _Mock at your Sins_ Prov. 3. 17. yet now that\\nyou see that God's Hand hath reached you, and brought you to publick\\nJustice, I hope your present unhappy Circumstances hath made you seriously\\nreflect upon your past Actions and Course of Life; and that you are now\\nsensible of the Greatness of your Sins, and that you find the Burden of\\nthem is intolerable.\\n\\nAnd that therefore being thus _labouring, and heavy laden with Sin_, Mat.\\n11. 28. you will esteem that as the most valuable _Knowledge_, that can\\nshew you how you can be reconciled to that Supreme God that you have so\\nhighly offended; and that can reveal to you Him who is not only the\\npowerful _Advocate with the Father for you_, 1 John 2. 1. but also who hath\\npaid that Debt that is due for your Sins by his own Death upon the Cross\\nfor you; and thereby made full Satisfaction for the Justice of God. And\\nthis is to be found no where but in God's Word, which discovers to us that\\n_Lamb of God which takes away the Sins of the World_, John 1. 29. which is\\n_Christ_ the Son of God: For this know, and be assured, _that there is none\\nother Name under Heaven given among Men, whereby we must be saved_, Acts 4.\\n12. but only by the Name of the Lord _Jesus_.\\n\\nBut then consider how he invites all Sinners to come unto him, and, _that\\nhe will give them rest_, Matt. 11. 28. for he assures us, _that he came to\\nseek and to save that which was lost_, Luke 19. 10, Mat. 18. 11. and hath\\npromised, _that he that cometh unto him, he will in no wise cast out_, John\\n6. 37.\\n\\nSo that if now you will sincerely turn to him, tho' late, even at the\\n_eleventh Hour_, Mat. 20. 6, 9. he will receive you.\\n\\nBut surely I need not tell you, that the _Terms_ of his _Mercy_ is _Faith_\\nand _Repentance_.\\n\\nAnd do not mistake the _Nature_ of Repentance to be only a bare Sorrow for\\nyour Sins, arising from the Consideration of the _Evil_ and _Punishment_\\nthey have now brought upon you; but your Sorrow must arise from the\\nConsideration of your having offended a gracious and merciful God.\\n\\nBut I shall not pretend to give you any particular Directions as to the\\nNature of Repentance: I consider that I speak to a Person, whose Offences\\nhave proceeded not so much from his not _knowing_, as his _slighting_ and\\n_neglecting_ his _Duty_: Neither is it proper for me to give Advice out of\\nthe Way of my own Profession.\\n\\nYou may have that better delivered to you by those who have made Divinity\\ntheir particular Study; and who, by their Knowledge, as well as their\\nOffice, as being the _Ambassadors of Christ_, 2 Cor. 5. 20. are best\\nqualified to give you Instructions therein.\\n\\nI only heartily wish, that what, in Compassion to your Soul, I have now\\nsaid to you upon this sad and solemn Occasion, by exhorting you in general\\nto _Faith_ and _Repentance_, may have that due Effect upon you, that\\nthereby you may become a true _Penitent_.\\n\\nAnd therefore having now discharged my Duty to you as a _Christian_, by\\ngiving you the best Counsel I can, with respect to the Salvation of your\\nSoul, I must now do my Office as a _Judge_.\\n\\nThe _Sentence_ that the Law hath appointed to pass upon you for your\\nOffences, and which this Court doth therefore award, is,\\n\\n                                * * *\\n\\n_That you, the said_ Stede Bonnet, _shall go from hence to the Place from\\nwhence you came, and from thence to the Place of Execution, where you shall\\nbe hanged by the Neck till you are dead_.\\n\\n_And the God of infinite Mercy be merciful to your Soul_.\\n\\nCHAP. V. OF Capt. _Edward England_, And his CREW.\\n\\nE_Dward England_ went Mate of a Sloop that sail'd out of _Jamaica_,\\nand was taken by Captain _Winter_, a Pyrate, just before their Settlement\\nat _Providence_; from whence _England_ had the Command of a Sloop in the\\nsame laudable Employment: It is surprizing that Men of good Understanding\\nshould engage in a Course of Life, that so much debases humane Nature, and\\nsets them upon a Level with the wild Beasts of the Forest, who live and\\nprey upon their weaker Fellow Creatures: A Crime so enormous! That it\\nincludes almost all others, as Murder, Rapine, Theft, Ingratitude, _&c._\\nand tho' they make these Vices familiar to them by their daily Practice,\\nyet these Men are so inconsistent with themselves, that a Reflection made\\nupon their Honour, their Justice, or their Courage, is look'd upon as an\\nOffence that ought to be punished with the Life of him that commits it:\\n_England_ was one of these Men, who seem'd to have such a Share of Reason,\\nas should have taught him better Things. He had a great deal of good\\nNature, and did not want for Courage; he was not avaritious, and always\\naverse to the ill Usage Prisoners received: He would have been contented\\nwith moderate Plunder, and less mischievous Pranks, could his Companions\\nhave been brought to the same Temper, but he was generally over-rul'd, and\\nas he was engaged in that abominable Society, he was obliged to be a\\nPartner in all their vile Actions.\\n\\nCaptain _England_ sail'd to the Coast of _Africa_, after the Island of\\n_Providence_ was settled by the _English_ Government, and the Pyrates\\nsurrendered to his Majesty's Proclamation; and took several Ships and\\nVessels, particularly the _Cadogan_ Snow belonging to _Bristol_, at\\n_Sierraleone_, one _Skinner_ Master, who was inhumanly murthered by some of\\nthe Crew, that had lately been his own Men, and served in the said Vessel.\\nIt seems some Quarrel had happened between them, so that _Skinner_ thought\\nfit to remove these Fellows on Board of a Man of War, and at the same Time\\nrefused them their Wages; not long after they found Means to desert that\\nService, and shipping themselves aboard a Sloop in the _West-Indies_, was\\ntaken by a Pyrate, and brought to _Providence_, and sailed upon the same\\nAccount along with Captain _England_.\\n\\nAssoon as _Skinner_ had struck to the Pyrate, he was ordered to come on\\nBoard in his Boat, which he did, and the Person that he first cast his Eye\\nupon, proved to be his old Boatswain, who star'd him in the Face like his\\nevil Genius, and accosted him in this Manner.-- _Ah, Captain_ Skinner! _Is\\nit you? The only Man I wished to see; I am much in your Debt, and now I\\nshall pay you all in your own Coin_.\\n\\nThe poor Man trembled every Joint, when he found into what Company he had\\nfallen, and dreaded the Event, as he had Reason enough so to do; for the\\nBoatswain immediately called to his Consorts, laid hold of the Captain, and\\nmade him fast to the Windless, and there pelted him with Glass Bottles,\\nwhich cut him in a sad Manner; after which they whipp'd him about the Deck,\\ntill they were weary, being deaf to all his Prayers and Intreaties, and at\\nlast, because he had been a good Master to his Men, they said, he should\\nhave an easy Death, and so shot him thro' the Head. They took some few\\nThings out of the Snow, but gave the Vessel and all her Cargo to _Howel\\nDavis_ the Mate; and the rest of the Crew, as will be hereafter mentioned\\nin the Chapter of Captain _Davis_.\\n\\nCaptain _England_ took a Ship called the _Pearl_, Captain _Tyzard_\\nCommander, for which he exchanged his own Sloop, fitted her up for the\\npyratical Account, and new christen'd her, the _Royal James_, with which he\\ntook several Ships and Vessels of different Nations at the _Azores_ and\\n_Cape de Verd Islands_.\\n\\nIn the Spring, 1719, the Rovers returned to _Africa_, and beginning at the\\nRiver _Gambia_, sailed all down the Coast; and between that and _Cape\\nCorso_, took the following Ships and Vessels.\\n\\nThe _Eagle_ Pink, Captain _Rickets_ Commander belonging to _Cork_, taken\\nthe 25th of _March_, having 6 Guns and 17 Men on Board, seven of which\\nturned Pyrates.\\n\\nThe _Charlotte_, Captain _Oldson_, of _London_, taken _May_ the 26th,\\nhaving 8 Guns and 18 Men on Board, 13 of which turned Pyrates.\\n\\nThe _Sarah_, Captain _Stunt_, of _London_, taken the 27th of _May_, having\\n4 Guns and 18 Men on Board, 3 of which turned Pyrates.\\n\\nThe _Bentworth_, Captain _Gardener_, of _Bristol_, taken the 27th of _May_,\\nhaving 12 Guns and 30 Men on Board, 12 of which turned Pyrates.\\n\\nThe _Buck_ Sloop, Captain _Sylvester_, of _Gambia_, taken the 27th of\\n_May_, having 2 Guns and 2 Men on Board, and both turned Pyrates.\\n\\nThe _Carteret_, Captain _Snow_, of _London_, taken the 28th of _May_,\\nhaving 4 Guns and 18 Men on Board, 5 of which turned Pyrates.\\n\\nThe _Mercury_, Captain _Maggott_, of _London_, taken the 29th of _May_,\\nhaving 4 Guns and 18 Men on Board, 5 of which turned Pyrates.\\n\\nThe _Coward_ Galley, Captain _Creed_, of _London_, taken the 17th of\\n_June_, having 2 Guns and 13 Men on Board, 4 of which turned Pyrates.\\n\\nThe _Elizabeth_ and _Katherine_, Captain _Bridge_ of _Barbadoes_, taken\\n_June_ the 27th, having 6 Guns and 14 Men on Board, 4 of which turned\\nPyrates.\\n\\nThe _Eagle_ Pink being bound to _Jamaica_, the _Sarah_ to _Virginia_, and\\nthe _Buck_ to _Maryland_, they let them go, but the _Charlotte_, the\\n_Bentworth_, the _Carteret_, and the _Coward_ Galley, they burnt; and the\\n_Mercury_, and the _Elizabeth_ and _Katherine_ were fitted up for Pyrate\\nShips, the former was new nam'd _Queen Ann_'s _Revenge_, and commanded by\\none _Lane_, and the other was call'd the _Flying King_, of which _Robert\\nSample_ was appointed Captain. These two left _England_ upon the Coast,\\nsail'd to the _West-Indies_, where they took some Prizes, clean'd, and\\nsail'd to _Brasil_ in _November_; they took several _Portuguese_ Ships\\nthere, and did a great deal of Mischief, but in the height of their\\nUndertakings, a _Portuguese_ Man of War, which was an excellent Sailor,\\ncame a very unwelcome Guest to them, and gave them Chace; the Queen _Ann's\\nRevenge_ got off, but was lost a little while after upon that Coast; and\\nthe _Flying King_, giving herself over for lost, ran ashore: There were\\nthen 70 Men on Board, 12 of which were kill'd, and the rest taken\\nPrisoners, of whom the _Portuguese_ hang'd 38, of which 32 were _English_,\\nthree _Dutch_, two _French_, and one of their own Nation.\\n\\n_England_, in going down the Coast, took the _Peterborough_ Galley of\\n_Bristol_, Captain _Owen_; and the _Victory_, Captain _Ridout_; the former\\nthey detained, but plundered the latter, and let her go. In _Cape Corso_\\nRoad, they saw two Sail at Anchor, but before they could reach them, they\\nslipp'd their Cables and got close under _Cape Corso Castle_, these were\\nthe _Whydah_, Captain _Prince_, and the _John_, Captain _Rider_: The\\nPyrates upon this made a fire Ship of a Vessel they had lately taken, and\\nattempted to burn them, as tho' they had been a common Enemy, which if\\neffected, they could not have been one Farthing the better for it; but the\\nCastle firing warmly upon them, they withdrew, and sail'd down to _Whydah_\\nRoad, where they found another Pyrate, one Captain _la Bouche_, who getting\\nthither before _England_ arrived, had forestall'd the Market, and greatly\\ndisappointed their Brethren.\\n\\nCaptain _England_, after this Baulk, went into a Harbour, clean'd his own\\nShip, and fitted up the _Peterborough_, which he call'd the _Victory_; they\\nliv'd there very wantonly for several Weeks, making free with the Negroe\\nWomen, and committing such outragious Acts, that they came to an open\\nRupture with the Natives, several of whom they kill'd, and one of their\\nTowns they set on Fire.\\n\\nWhen the Pyrates came out to Sea, they put it to a Vote what Voyage to\\ntake, and the Majority carrying it for the _East-Indies_, they shap'd their\\nCourse accordingly, and arrived at _Madagascar_, the Beginning of the Year\\n1720. They staid not long there, but after taking in Water and Provisions,\\nsail'd for the Coast of _Malabar_, which is a fine fruitful Country in the\\n_East-Indies_, in the Empire of the _Mogul_, but immediately subject to its\\nown Princes: It reaches from the Coast of _Canara_ to _Cape Camorin_, which\\nis between 7° 30, and 12° North Lattitude, and in about 75° East Longitude,\\ncounting from the Meridian of _London_. The old Natives are Pagans, but\\nthere are a great Number of _Mahometans_ inhabiting among them, who are\\nMerchants, and generally rich. On the same Coast, but in a Province to the\\nNorthward lies _Goa, Surat, Bombay_, where the _English, Dutch_, and\\n_Portuguese_ have Settlements.\\n\\nHither our Pyrates came, having made a Tour of half the Globe, as the\\nPsalmist says of the Devils, _Going about like roaring Lions, seeking whom\\nthey might devour_. They took several Country Ships, that is, _Indian_\\nVessels, and one European, a _Dutch_ Ship, which they exchanged for one of\\ntheir own, and then came back to _Madagascar_.\\n\\nThey sent several of their Hands on Shore with Tents, Powder, and Shot, to\\nkill Hogs, Venison, and such other fresh Provision as the Island afforded,\\nand a Whim came into their Heads to seek out for the Remains of _Avery_'s\\nCrew, whom they knew to be settled somewhere in the Island.--Accordingly\\nsome of them travell'd several Days Journey, without hearing any\\nIntelligence of them, and so were forc'd to return with the Loss of their\\nLabour, for these Men were settled on the other Side of the Island, as has\\nbeen taken Notice of under the Chapter of _Avery_.\\n\\nThey stay'd not long here, after they had clean'd their Ships, but sailing\\nto _Juanna_; they met two _English_, and one _Ostend India_ Men, coming out\\nof that Harbour, one of which, after a desperate Resistance, they took; the\\nParticulars of which Action is at length related in the following Letter,\\nwrote by the Captain from _Bombay_.\\n\\nA LETTER from Captain _Mackra_, dated at _Bombay, Nov._ 16, 1720.\\n\\nW_E arrived the_ 25_th of_ July _last, in Company of the_ Greenwich,\\n_at_ Juanna, (_an Island not far from_ Madagascar) _putting in there to\\nrefresh our Men, we found fourteen Pyrates that came in their Canoes from\\nthe_ Mayotta, _where the Pyrate Ship to which they belong'd_, viz. _the_\\nIndian Queen, _two hundred and fifty Tons, twenty eight Guns, and ninety\\nMen, commanded by Capt._ Oliver de la Bouche, _bound from the_ Guinea\\n_Coast to the_ East-Indies, _had been bulged and lost. They said they left\\nthe Captain and_ 40 _of their Men building a new Vessel to proceed on their\\nwicked Design. Capt._ Kirby _and I concluding it might be of great Service\\nto the_ East-India _Company to destroy such a Nest of Rogues, were ready to\\nsail for that Purpose the_ 17_th of_ August, _about Eight o'Clock in the\\nMorning, when we discovered two Pyrate Ships standing into the Bay of_\\nJuanna, _one of thirty four, and the other of thirty Guns. I immediately\\nwent on Board the_ Greenwich, _where they seem'd very diligent in\\nPreparations for an Engagement, and I left Capt._ Kirby _with mutual\\nPromises of standing by each other. I then unmoor'd, got under Sail, and\\nbrought two Boats a-head to row me close to the_ Greenwich; _but he being\\nopen to a Valley and a Breeze, made the best of his Way from me; which an_\\nOstender _in our Company, of_ 22 _Guns, seeing, did the same, though the\\nCaptain had promised heartily to engage with us, and I believe would have\\nbeen as good as his Word, if Capt._ Kirby _had kept his. About half an Hour\\nafter Twelve, I called several times to the_ Greenwich _to bear down to our\\nAssistance, and fir'd Shot at him, but to no Purpose. For tho' we did not\\ndoubt but he would join us, because when he got about a League from us, he\\nbrought his Ship to, and look'd on, yet both he and the_ Ostender _basely\\ndeserted us, and left us engaged with barbarous and inhuman Enemies, with\\ntheir black and bloody Flags hanging over us, without the least Appearance\\nof escaping being cut to Pieces. But God, in his good Providence,\\ndetermin'd otherwise; for notwithstanding their Superiority, we engaged 'em\\nboth about three Hours, during which, the biggest received some Shot\\nbetwixt Wind and Water, which made her keep off a little to stop her Leaks.\\nThe other endeavoured all she could to board us, by rowing with her Oars,\\nbeing within half a Ship's Length of us above an Hour; but by good Fortune\\nwe shot all her Oars to Pieces, which prevented them, and by consequence\\nsaved our Lives_.\\n\\n_About Four o'Clock, most of the Officers and Men posted on the\\nQuarter-Deck being killed and wounded, the largest Ship making up to us\\nwith all Diligence, being still within a Cable's Length of us, often giving\\nus a Broadside, and no hopes of Capt._ Kirby_'s coming to our Assistance,\\nwe endeavoured to run ashoar; and tho' we drew four Foot Water more than\\nthe Pyrate, it pleased God that he stuck fast on a higher Ground than we\\nhappily fell in with; so was disappointed a second time from boarding us.\\nHere we had a more violent Engagement than before. All my Officers, and\\nmost of my Men, behaved with unexpected Courage; and as we had a\\nconsiderable Advantage by having a Broadside to his Bow, we did him great\\nDamage, so that had Capt._ Kirby _come in then, I believe we should have\\ntaken both, for we had one of them sure; but the other Pyrate_ (_who was\\nstill firing at us_) _seeing the_ Greenwich _did not offer to assist us, he\\nsupplied his Consort with three Boats full of fresh Men. About Five in the\\nEvening the_ Greenwich _stood clear away to Sea, leaving us struggling hard\\nfor Life in the very Jaws of Death; which the other Pyrate, that was\\nafloat, seeing, got a-warp out, and was hauling under our Stern; by which\\ntime many of my Men being killed and wounded, and no Hopes left us from\\nbeing all murdered by enraged barbarous Conquerors, I order'd all that\\ncould, to get into the Long-Boat under the Cover of the Smoak of our Guns;\\nso that with what some did in Boats, and others by swimming, most of us\\nthat were able got ashoar by Seven o' Clock. When the Pyrates came aboard,\\nthey cut three of our wounded Men to Pieces. I, with a few of my People,\\nmade what haste I could to the_ King's-Town, _twenty five Miles from us,\\nwhere I arrived next Day, almost dead with Fatigue and Loss of Blood,\\nhaving been sorely wounded in the Head by a Musket Ball_.\\n\\n_At this Town I heard that the Pyrates had offered ten thousand Dollars to\\nthe Country People to bring me in, which many of them would have accepted,\\nonly they knew the King and all his chief People were in my Interest. Mean\\ntime, I caused a Report to be spread, that I was dead of my Wounds, which\\nmuch abated their Fury. About ten Days after, being pretty well recovered,\\nand hoping the Malice of our Enemies was nigh over, I began to consider the\\ndismal Condition we were reduced to, being in a Place where we had no Hopes\\nof getting a Passage home, all of us in a manner naked, not having had Time\\nto get another Shirt, or a Pair of Shoes_.\\n\\n_Having obtained Leave to go on Board the Pyrates, and a Promise of Safety,\\nseveral of the Chief of them knew me, and some of them had sailed with me,\\nwhich I found of great Advantage; because, notwithstanding their Promise,\\nsome of them would have cut me, and all that would not enter with them, to\\nPieces, had it not been for the chief Captain_, Edward England, _and some\\nothers I knew. They talked of burning one of their Ships, which we had so\\nentirely disabled, as to be no farther useful to them, and to fit the_\\nCassandra _in her room; but in the End I managed my Tack so well, that they\\nmade me a Present of the said shattered Ship, which was_ Dutch _built,\\ncalled the_ Fancy, _about three hundred Tons, and also a hundred and twenty\\nnine Bales of the Company's Cloth, tho' they would not give me a Rag of my\\nCloathes_.\\n\\n_They sailed the_ 3_d of_ September; _and with Jury-Masts, and such old\\nSails as they left me, I made shift to do the like on the_ 8_th, together\\nwith forty three of my Ship's Crew, including two Passengers and twelve\\nSoldiers, having but five Tons of Water aboard; and after a Passage of\\nforty eight Days, I arrived here_ October 26, _almost naked and starv'd,\\nhaving been reduced to a Pint of Water a Day, and almost in despair of ever\\nseeing Land, by Reason of the Calms we met with between the Coast of_\\nArabia _and_ Malabar.--_We had in all thirteen Men killed and twenty four\\nwounded; and we were told, that we had destroyed about ninety or a hundred\\nof the Pyrates. When they left us, they were about three hundred Whites and\\neighty Blacks in both Ships. I am persuaded, had our Consort the_ Greenwich\\n_done his Duty, we had destroyed both of them, and got two hundred thousand\\nPounds for our Owners and selves; whereas to his deserting us, the Loss of\\nthe_ Cassandra _may justly be imputed. I have delivered all the Bales that\\nwere given me into the Company's Warehouse, for which the Governor and\\nCouncil have ordered me a Reward. Our Governor, Mr._ Boon, _who is extreme\\nkind and civil to me, has ordered me home with this Pacquet; but Captain_\\nHarvey, _who had a prior Promise, being come in with the Fleet, goes in my\\nroom. The Governor hath promis'd me a Country Voyage, to help make me up my\\nLosses, and would have me stay to go home with him next Year_.\\n\\n                                * * *\\n\\nCaptain _Mackra_ certainly run a great Hazard, in going aboard the Pyrate,\\nand began quickly to repent his Credulity; for though they had promised,\\nthat no Injury should be done to his Person, he found their Words were not\\nto be trusted; and it may be supposed, that nothing but the desperate\\nCircumstances Captain _Mackra_ imagined himself to be in, could have\\nprevailed upon him to fling himself and Company into their Hands, perhaps\\nnot knowing how firmly the Natives of that Island were attach'd to the\\n_English_ Nation; for about 20 Years ago, Captain _Cornwall_, Commadore of\\nan _English_ Squadron, assisted them against another Island called\\n_Mohilla_, for which they have ever since communicated all the grateful\\nOffices in their Power, insomuch that it became a Proverb, _That an_\\nEnglishman, _and a_ Juanna _Man were all one_.\\n\\n_England_ was inclined to favour Captain _Mackra_; but he was so free to\\nlet him know, that his Interest was declining amongst them; and that the\\nPyrates were so provoked at the Resistance he made against them, that he\\nwas afraid he should hardly be able to protect him; he therefore advised\\nhim to sooth up and manage the Temper of Captain _Taylor_, a Fellow of a\\nmost barbarous Nature, who was become a great Favourite amongst them for no\\nother Reason than because he was a greater Brute than the rest. _Mackra_\\ndid what he could to soften this Beast, and ply'd him with warm Punch;\\nnotwithstanding which, they were in a Tumult whether they should make an\\nEnd of him, or no, when an Accident happen'd which turn'd to the Favour of\\nthe poor Captain; a Fellow with a terrible pair of Whiskers, and a wooden\\nLeg, being stuck round with Pistols, like the Man in the Almanack with\\nDarts, comes swearing and vapouring upon the Quarter-Deck, and asks, in a\\ndamning Manner, which was Captain _Mackra_: The Captain expected no less\\nthan that this Fellow would be his Executioner;--but when he came near him,\\nhe took him by the Hand, swearing, _Damn him he was glad to see him; and\\nshew me the Man_, says he, _that offers to hurt Captain_ Mackra, _for I'll\\nstand by him_; and so with many Oaths told him, _he was an honest Fellow,\\nand that he had formerly sail'd with him_.\\n\\nThis put an End to the Dispute, and Captain _Taylor_ was so mellow'd with\\nthe Punch, that he consented that the old Pyrate Ship, and so many Bales of\\nCloth should be given to Captain _Mackra_, and so he fell asleep. _England_\\nadvised Captain _Mackra_ to get off with all Expedition, least when the\\nBeast should awake, he might repent his Generosity: Which Advice was\\nfollowed by the Captain.\\n\\nCaptain _England_ having sided so much to Captain _Mackra_'s Interest, was\\na Means of making him many Enemies among the Crew; they thinking such good\\nUsage inconsistent with their Polity, because it looked like procuring\\nFavour at the Aggravation of their Crimes; therefore upon Imagination or\\nReport, that Captain _Mackra_ was fitting out against them, with the\\nCompany's Force, he was soon _abdicated_ or pulled out of his Government,\\nand marooned with three more on the Island of _Mauritius_: An Island\\nindeed, not to be complained of, had they accumulated any Wealth by their\\nVillanies that would have afforded some future comfortable Prospect, for it\\nabounds with Fish, Deer, Hogs and other Flesh. Sir _Thomas Herbert_, says,\\nthe Shores with Coral and Ambergrease; but I believe the _Dutch_ had not\\ndeserted it, had there been much of these Commodities to have been found.\\nIt was in 1722, resettled by the _French_, who have a Fort at another\\nneighbouring Island, called _Don Mascarine_, and are touched at for Water,\\nWood, and Refreshments, by _French_ Ships bound to, or for _India_; as St.\\n_Helena_ and _Cape Bon Esperance_, are by us and the _Dutch_. From this\\nPlace, Captain _England_ and his Companions having made a little Boat of\\nStaves and old Pieces of Deal left there, went over to _Madagascar_, where\\nthey subsist at present on the Charity of some of their Brethren, who had\\nmade better Provision for themselves, than they had done.\\n\\nThe Pyrates detained some Officers and Men belonging to Captain _Mackra_,\\nand having repaired the Damages received in their Rigging, they sailed for\\n_India_. The Day before they made Land, saw two Ships to the Eastward, who\\nat first Sight, they took to be _English_, and ordered one of the\\nPrisoners, who had been an Officer with Captain _Mackra_, to tell them the\\nprivate Signals between the Company's Ships, the Captain swearing he would\\ncut him in pound Pieces, if he did not do it immediately; but unable, was\\nforced to bear their Scurility, till they came up with them, and found they\\nwere two _Moor_ Ships from _Muscat_, with Horses; they brought the Captain\\nof them, and Merchants, on Board, torturing them, and rifling the Ships, in\\norder to discover Riches, as believing they came from _Mocha_; but being\\nbaulked in their Expectation, and next Morning seeing Land, and at the same\\nTime a Fleet in Shore plying to Windward, they were puzzled how to dispose\\nof them; to let them go, was to discover and ruin the Voyage, and it was\\ncruel to sink the Men and Horses with the Ships, (as many of them were\\ninclined to,) therefore, as a Medium, they brought them to an Anchor, threw\\nall their Sails over-board, and cut one of the Ships Masts half through.\\n\\nWhile they lay at an Anchor, and were all the next Day employed in taking\\nout Water, one of the aforementioned Fleet bore towards them with _English_\\nColours, answered with a red Ensign from the Pyrates, but did not speak\\nwith one another. At Night they left the _Muscatt_ Ships, weighed with the\\nSea Wind, and stood to the Northward after this Fleet: About four next\\nMorning, just as they were getting under sail, with the Land Wind, the\\nPyrates came amongst them, made no stop, but fired their great and small\\nGuns very briskly, till they got through; and as Day-Light cleared, were in\\na great Consternation in their Minds, having all along taken them for\\n_Angria_'s Fleet; what to do was the Point, whether run or pursue? They\\nwere sensible of their Inferiority of Strength, having no more than 300 Men\\nin both Ships, and 40 of them Negroes; besides, the _Victory_ had then four\\nPumps at Work, and must inevitably been lost before, had it not been for\\nsome Hand-Pumps, and several pair of Standards brought out of the\\n_Cassandra_, to relieve and strengthen her; but observing the Indifferency\\nof the Fleet, chose rather to chase than run; and thought the best Way to\\nsave themselves, was to play at Bullbeggar with the Enemy: So they came up\\nwith the Sea Wind, about Gun-Shot to Leeward, the great Ships of the Fleet\\na-head, and some others a-stern; which latter they took for Fire-Vessels:\\nAnd these a-head gaining from them by cutting away their Boats, they could\\ndo nothing more than continue their Course all Night, which they did, and\\nfound them next Morning out of Sight, excepting a Ketch and some few\\nGallivats, (_small sort of Vessels something like the Feluccas of the_\\nMediterranean, _and hoists, like them, triangular Sails_.) They bore down,\\nwhich the Ketch perceiving, transported her People on Board a Gallivat, and\\nset fire to her; the other proved too nimble and made off. The same Day\\nthey chased another Gallivat and took her, being come from _Gogo_, bound\\nfor _Callicut_ with Cotton. Of these Men they enquired concerning the\\nFleet, supposing they must have been in it; and altho' they protested they\\nhad not seen a Ship or Boat since they left _Gogo_, and pleaded very\\nearnestly for Favour; yet they threw all their Cargo over-board, and\\nsquezed their Joints in a Vice, to extort Confession: But they entirely\\nignorant of who or what this Fleet should be, were obliged not only to\\nsustain this Torment, but next Day a fresh easterly Wind having split the\\nGallivats Sails, they put her Company into the Boat, with nothing but a\\nTrysail, no Provisions, and only four Gallons of Water, (half of it Salt,)\\nand then out of Sight of Land, to shift for themselves.\\n\\nFor the better elucidating of this Story, it may be convenient to inform\\nthe Reader, who _Angria_ is, and what the Fleet were, that had so scurvily\\nbehaved themselves.\\n\\n_Angria_ is a famous _Indian_ Pyrate, of considerable Strength and\\nTerritories, that gives continual Disturbance to the _European_ (and\\nespecially the _English_) Trade: His chief Hold is _Callaba_, not many\\nLeagues from _Bombay_, and has one Island in Sight of that Port, whereby he\\ngains frequent Opportunities of annoying the Company. It would not be so\\ninsuperable a Difficulty to suppress him, if the Shallowness of the Water\\ndid not prevent Ships of War coming nigh: And a better Art he has, of\\nbribing the _Mogul_'s Ministers for Protection, when he finds an Enemy too\\npowerful.\\n\\nIn the Year 1720, the _Bombay_ Fleet consisting of four _Grabbs, (Ships\\nbuilt in_ India _by the Company, and have three Masts, a Prow like a\\nRow-Galley, instead of a Boltsprit, about_ 150 _Tons; are officered and\\narmed like a Man of War, for Defence and Protection of the Trade,)_ the\\n_London, Chandois_, and two other Ships with Gallivats, who besides their\\nproper Compliments, carried down 1000 Men to bombard and batter _Gayra_, a\\nFort belonging to _Angria_, on the _Malabar_ Coast, which they having\\nperformed ineffectually, were returning to _Bombay_, and, to make amends,\\nfell in with the Pyrates, to the Purpose has been already related. Captain\\n_Upton_, Commadore of that Fleet, prudently objecting to Mr. _Brown_, (who\\nwent General,) That the Ships were not to be hazarded, since they sailed\\nwithout their Governor _Boon_'s Orders to engage; and besides, that they\\ndid not come out with such a Design. This favourable Opportunity of\\ndestroying the Pyrates, angered the Governor, and he transferred the\\nCommand of the Fleet to Captain _Mackra_, who had Orders immediately to\\npursue and engage, where ever he met them.\\n\\nThe Vice-Roy of _Goa_, assisted by the _English_ Company's Fleet from\\n_Bombay_, did attempt the Reduction of _Callaba_, his principal Place,\\nlanded 8 or 10000 Men the next Year, the _English_ Squadron of Men of War\\nbeing then in those Seas; but having viewed the Fortification well, and\\nexpended some of their Army by Sickness and the Fatigues of a Camp,\\ncarefully withdrew again.\\n\\nI return to the Pyrates, who, after they had sent away the Gallivats\\nPeople, resolved to cruise to the Southward; and the next Day, between\\n_Goa_ and _Carwar_, heard several Guns, which brought them to an Anchor,\\nand they sent their Boat on the Scent, who returned about two in the\\nMorning, and brought Word of two Grabs lying at Anchor in the Road. They\\nweighed and ran towards the Bay, till Day-Light gave the Grabs Sight of\\nthem, and was but just Time enough to get under _India Diva_ Castle, out of\\ntheir reach; this displeased the Pyrates the more, in that they wanted\\nWater; and some were for making a Descent that Night and taking the Island,\\nbut it not being approved of by the Majority, they proceeded to the\\nSouthward, and took next in their Way, a small Ship out of _Onnore_ Road,\\nwith only a _Dutch_ Man and two _Portuguese_ on Board. They sent one of\\nthese on Shore to the Captain, to acquaint him, if he would supply them\\nwith some Water, and fresh Provisions, he should have his Ship again; and\\nthe Master returned for answer, by his Mate _Frank Harmless_, that if they\\nwould deliver him Possession over the Bar, he would comply with their\\nRequest; the Proposal the Mate thought was collusive, and they rather\\njump'd into _Harmless_'s Opinion, (who very honestly entered with them,)\\nand resolved to seek Water at the _Laccadeva_ Islands; so having sent the\\nother Persons on Shore, with threats, that he should be the last Man they\\nwould give Quarter too, (by Reason of this uncivil Usage;) they put\\ndirectly for the Islands, and arrived there in three Days: Where being\\ninformed by a Menchew they took (with the Governor of _Canwars_ Pass,) of\\nthere being no Anchor-Ground among them, and _Melinda_ being the next\\nconvenient Island, they sent their Boats on Shore, to see if there was any\\nWater, and whether it was inhabited or not; who returned with an Answer to\\ntheir Satisfaction, _viz._ that there was abundance of good Water, and many\\nHouses, but deserted by the Men, who had fled to the neighbouring Islands\\non the Approach of Ships, and left only the Women and Children to guard one\\nanother. The Women they forced in a Barbarous Manner to their Lusts, and to\\nrequire them, destroyed their Cocoa Trees, and fired several of their\\nHouses and _Churches_. (I suppose built by the _Portuguese_, who formerly\\nused there, in their Voyages to _India_.)\\n\\nWhile they were at this Island, they lost three or four Anchors, by the\\nRockyness of the Ground, Freshness of Winds, and at last were forced thence\\nby a harder Gale than ordinary, leaving 70 People, Blacks and Whites, and\\nmost of their Water Casks: In ten Days they regained the Island again,\\nfilled their Water, and took the People on Board.\\n\\nProvisions were very scarce, and they now resolved to visit their good\\nFriends the _Dutch_, at _Cochin_, who, if you will believe these Rogues,\\nnever fail of supplying Gentlemen of their Profession. After three Days\\nsail, they arrived off _Tellechery_, and took a small Vessel belonging to\\nGovernor _Adams, John Tawke_ Master, whom they brought on Board very drunk,\\nand he giving an Account of Captain _Mackra_'s fitting out, put them in a\\nTempest of Passion: _A Villain_, say they, _that we have treated so\\ncivilly, as to give him a Ship and other Presents, and now to be armed\\nagainst us, he ought to be hanged; and since we cannot show our Resentment\\non him, let us hang the Dogs his People, who wish him well, and would do\\nthe same, if clear. If it be in my Power_, says the Quarter-Master, _both\\nMasters and Officers of Ships shall be carried with us for the future, only\\nto plague them. --d--n_ England.\\n\\nThence they proceeded to _Calicut_, where they endeavoured to take a large\\n_Moor_ Ship out of the Road, but was prevented by some Guns mounted on\\nShore, and discharged at them: Mr. _Lasinby_, who was one of Captain\\n_Mackra_'s Officers, and detained, was under the Deck at this Time, and\\ncommanded both by the Captain and Quarter Master of the Pyrates, to tend\\nthe Braces on the Booms, in hopes, it was believed, a Shot would take him\\nbefore they got clear, asking the Reason why he was not there before? And\\nwhen he would have excused himself, threat'ned on the like Neglect to shoot\\nhim; at which the other beginning to expostulate farther, and claim their\\nPromise of putting him ashore, got an unmerciful beating from the\\nQuarter-Master. Captain _Taylor_, who was now Successor to _England_, and\\nwhose Priviledge it was to do so, being lame of his Hands, and unable.\\n\\nThe next Day in their Passage down, came up with a _Dutch_ Galliot, bound\\nfor _Calicut_ with Lime Stone, and aboard of her they put Captain _Tawke_,\\nand sent him away, and several of the People interceeded for _Lasinby_ in\\nvain, _For_, says _Taylor_ and his Party, _if we let this Dog go, who has\\nheard our Designs and Resolutions, we overset all our well advised\\nProjections, and particularly this Supply we are now seeking for, at the\\nHands of the_ Dutch.\\n\\nIt was but one Day more before they arrived off _Cochin_, where, by a\\nFishing-Canoe, they sent a Letter on Shore; and in the Afternoon, with the\\nSea-breeze, ran into the Road and anchored, saluting the Fort with 11 Guns\\neach Ship, and received the Return, in an equal Number; a good Omen of the\\nwelcome Reception they found; for at Night there came on Board a large\\nBoat, deeply laden with fresh Provisions and Liquors, and with it a Servant\\n(of a favourite Inhabitant) called _John Trumpet_: He told them they must\\nimmediately weigh, and run farther to the Southward, where they should be\\nsupplied with all Things they wanted, naval Stores or Provisions.\\n\\nThey had not been long at Anchor again, before they had several Canoes on\\nBoard with both black and white Inhabitants, who continued, without\\nInterruption, all good Offices, during their Stay; particularly _John\\nTrumpet_ brought a large Boat of Arrack, than which, nothing could be more\\npleasing (about 90 Legers,) as also 60 Bales of Sugar; an Offering, its\\npresumed, from the Governor and his Daughter, who, in Return, had a fine\\nTable-Clock sent him, (the Plunder of Captain _Mackra_'s Ship,) and she a\\nlarge Gold Watch, Earnests of the Pay they designed to make.\\n\\nWhen they had all on Board, they paid Mr. _Trumpet_ to his Satisfaction, it\\nwas computed, 6 or 7000 _l._ gave him three Cheers, 11 Guns each Ship, and\\nthrow'd Ducatoons into his Boat by handfuls, for the Boat-Men to scramble\\nfor.\\n\\nThat Night being little Wind, did not weigh, and _Trumpet_, in the Morning,\\nwaked them to the Sight of more Arrack, Chests of Piece-Goods, and ready\\nmade Clothes, bringing the Fiscal of the Place also with him. At Noon,\\nwhile those were on Board, saw a Sail to the Southward, which they weighed,\\nand chaced after; but she having a good Offing, got to the Northward of\\nthem, and anchored a small Distance from _Cochin_ Fort; the aforementioned\\nGentlemen assuring them, that they would not be molested in taking her from\\nunder the Castle, sollicited before hand for the buying her, and advised\\nthem to stand in, which they did boldly, to board her; but when they came\\nwithin a Cable's length or two of the Chace, now near Shore, the Fort fired\\ntwo small Guns, whose Shot falling nigh their Muzzels, they instantly bore\\nout of the Road, made an easy Sail to the Southward, and anchored at Night\\nin their former Birth, where _John Trumpet_, to engage their Stay a little\\nlonger, informed them, that in a few Days a very rich Ship was to pass by,\\ncommanded by the General of _Bombay_'s Brother.\\n\\nThis Governor is an Emblem of foreign Power. What Inconvenience and Injury\\nmust the Master's Subjects sustain under one who can truckle to such\\ntreacherous and base Means, as corresponding and trading with Pyrates to\\nenrich himself? Certainly such a Man will stickle at no Injustice to repair\\nor make a Fortune. He has the _Argumentum bacillum_ always in his own\\nHands, and can convince, when he pleases, in half the Time of other\\nArguments, that Fraud and Oppression is Law. That he imploys Instruments in\\nsuch dirty Work, expresses the Guilt and Shame, but no way mitigates the\\nCrime. _John Trumpet_ was the Tool; but, as the Dog said in the Fable, on\\nanother Occasion, _What is done by the Master's Orders, is the Master's\\nActions_.\\n\\nI cannot but reflect, on this Occasion, what a vile Government _Sancho\\nPancho_ had of it; he had not only such _Perquisites_ rescinded, but was\\nreally almost starved; the Victuals taken from him almost every Day, and\\nonly under a Pretence of preserving his Excellency's Health: But\\nGovernments differ.\\n\\nFrom _Cochin_ some were for proceeding to _Madagascar_ directly; others\\nthought it proper to cruize till they got a Store-Ship, and these being the\\nMajority, they ply'd to the Southward, and after some Days saw a Ship in\\nShore, which being to Windward of them, they could not get nigh, till the\\nSea Wind, and Night, favouring, they separated, one to the Northward, the\\nother to the Southward, thinking to enclose her between: But to their\\nAstonishment, and contrary to Expectation, when Day broke, instead of the\\nChace, found themselves very near five Sail of tall Ships, who immediately\\nmaking a Signal for the Pyrates to bear down, put them in the utmost\\nConfusion, particularly _Taylor_'s Ship, because their Consort was at a\\nDistance from them, (at least three Leagues to the Southward) they stood to\\none another, and joined, and then together made the best of their Way from\\nthe Fleet, whom they judged to be commanded by Captain _Mackra_; of whose\\nCourage having Experience, they were glad to shun any farther Taste of.\\n\\nIn three Hours Chace, none of the Fleet gaining upon them, excepting one\\nGrab, their dejected Countenances cleared up again, the more, in that a\\nCalm succeeded for the Remainder of that Day; and in the Night, with the\\nLand Wind, they ran directly off Shore, and found next Day, to their great\\nConsolation, that they had lost Sight of all the Fleet.\\n\\nThis Danger escaped, they proposed to spend _Christmas_ (the _Christmas_ of\\n1720) in Carowzing and Forgetfulness, and kept it for three Days in a\\nwanton and riotous Way, not only eating, but wasting their fresh Provisions\\nin so wretched and inconsiderable a Manner, that when they had agreed after\\nthis to proceed to _Mauritius_, they were in that Passage at an Allowance\\nof a Bottle of Water _per Diem_, and not above two Pounds of Beef, and a\\nsmall Quantity of Rice, for ten Men for a Day; so that had it not been for\\nthe leaky Ship, (which once they were about to have quitted, and had done,\\nbut for a Quantity of Arrack and Sugar She had on Board,) they must most of\\nthem have perished.\\n\\nIn this Condition they arrived at the Island of _Mauritius_, about the\\nMiddle of _February_, sheathed and refitted the _Victory_, and on the 5th\\nof _April_ sailed again, leaving this terrible Inscription on one of the\\nWalls. _Left this Place the_ 5_th of_ April, _to go to_ Madagascar _for\\nLimes_, and this, least (like Lawyers and Men of Business) any Visits\\nshould be paid in their Absence: However, they did not sail directly for\\n_Madagascar_, but the Island _Mascarine_, and luckily as Rogues could wish,\\nthey found at their Arrival on the 8th, a _Portuguese_ Ship at Anchor, of\\n70 Guns, but most of them thrown overboard, her Masts lost, and so much\\ndisabled by a violent Storm they had met with in the Latitude of 13° South,\\nthat she became a Prize to the Pyrates, with very little or no Resistance,\\nand a glorious one indeed, having the _Conde de Ericeira_, Viceroy of\\n_Goa_, who made that fruitless Expedition against _Angria_, the _Indian_,\\nand several other Passengers on Board; who, as they could not be ignorant\\nof the Treasure she had in, did assert, that in the single Article of\\nDiamonds, there was to the Value of between three and four Millions of\\nDollars.\\n\\nThe Vice-Roy, who came on Board that Morning, in Expectation of the Ships\\nbeing _English_, was made a Prisoner, and obliged to ransome; but in\\nConsideration of his great Loss, (the Prize being Part his own,) they\\nagreed after some Demurrings, to accept of 2000 Dollars, and set him and\\nthe other Prisoners ashore, with Promises to leave a Ship that they might\\nTransport themselves, because the Island was not thought in a Condition to\\nmaintain so great a Number; and tho' they had learned from them, the\\nAccount of an _Ostender_ being to Leeward of the Island, which they took on\\nthat Information, (being formerly the _Greyhound_ Galley of _London_,) and\\ncould conveniently have comply'd with so reasonable a Request; yet they\\nsent the _Ostender_ with some of their People to _Madagascar_, with News of\\ntheir Success, and to prepare Masts for the Prize; and followed themselves\\nsoon after, without regard to the Sufferers, carrying 200 _Mozambique_\\nNegroes with them in the _Portuguese_ Ship.\\n\\n_Madagascar_ is an Island larger than _Great-Britain_, most of it within\\nthe Tropick of _Capricorn_, and lays East from the Eastern Side of\\n_Africa_: It abounds with Provisions of all Sorts, Oxen, Goats, Sheep,\\nPoultry, Fish, Citrons, Oranges, Tamarinds, Dates, Coco-Nuts, Bananas, Wax,\\nHoney, Rice; or in short, Cotton, Indigo, or any other Thing they will take\\nPains to plant, and have Understanding to manage: They have likewise Ebony,\\na hard Wood like Brasil, of which they make their Lances; and Gum of\\nseveral Sorts, Benzin, Dragon's Blood, Aloes, _&c_. What is most\\nincommodious, are the numerous Swarms of Locusts on the Land, and\\nCrocodiles or Alligators in their Rivers. Hither, in St. _Augustin_'s Bay,\\nthe Ships sometimes touch for Water, when they take the inner Passage for\\n_India_, and do not design to stop at _Johanna_; and we may observe from\\nthe sixth general Voyage set forth by the _East-India_ Company, in\\nConfirmation of what is hereafter said in Relation to Currents in general;\\nthat this inner Passage or Channel, has its Northern and Southern Currents\\nstrongest where the Channel is narrowest, and is less, and varies on\\ndifferent Points of the Compass, as the Sea comes to spread again, in the\\nPassage cross the Line.\\n\\nSince the Discovery of this Island by the _Portuguese, A. D._ 1506, the\\n_Europeans_, and particularly Pyrates, have increased a dark Mulatto Race\\nthere, tho' still few in Comparison with the Natives, who are Negroes, with\\ncurled short Hair, Active, and formerly represented malicious and\\nrevengeful, now tractable and communicable, perhaps owing to the Favours\\nand Generosity in Cloathing and Liquors, they from Time to Time have\\nreceived from these Fellows, who live in all possible Friendship, and can,\\nany single Man of them, command a Guard of 2 or 300 at a Minute's warning:\\nThis is farther the Native's Interest, to cultivate with them, because the\\nIsland being divided into petty Governments and Commands, the Pyrates,\\nsettled here, who are now a considerable Number, and have little Castles of\\ntheir own, can preponderate where-ever they think fit to side.\\n\\nWhen _Taylor_ came with the _Portuguese_ Prize here, they found the\\n_Ostender_ had played their Men a Trick, for they took Advantage of their\\nDrink, rise upon them, and (as they heard afterwards) carried the Ship to\\n_Mozambique_, whence the Governor ordered her for _Goa_.\\n\\nHere the Pyrates came, cleaned the _Cassandra_, and divided their Plunder,\\nsharing 42 small Diamonds a Man, or in less Proportion according to their\\nMagnitude. An ignorant, or a merry Fellow, who had only, one in this\\nDivision, as being judged equal, in Value to 42 small, muttered very much\\nat the Lot, and went and broke it in a Morter, swearing afterwards, he had\\na better Share than any of them, for he had beat it, he said, into 43\\nSparks.\\n\\nThose who were not for running the Hazard of their Necks, with 42 Diamonds,\\nbesides other Treasure, in their Pockets, knocked off, and stay'd with\\ntheir old Acquaintance at _Madagascar_, on mutual Agreements, the longer\\nLivers to take all. The Residue having therefore no Occasion for two Ships,\\nthe _Victory_ being leaky, she was burnt, the Men (as many as would) coming\\ninto the _Cassandra_, under the Command of _Taylor_, who we must leave a\\nTime, projecting either for _Cochin_, to dispose of their Diamonds among\\ntheir old Friends the _Dutch_, or else for the _Red_ or _China_ Seas, to\\navoid the Men of War, that continually clamoured in their Ears, a Noise of\\nDanger, and give the _little_ Account we are able, of that Squadron, who\\narrived in _India_, early in the Year 1721.\\n\\nAt _Cape Good Hope_, in _June_, the Commadore met with a Letter, which was\\nleft for him by the Governor of _Madras_, to whom it was wrote by the\\nGovernor of _Pandicherry_, a _French_ Factory, on the _Coromondel_ Coast,\\nsignifying, the Pyrates at the Writing of it, were then strong in the\\n_Indian_ Seas, having 11 Sail and 1500 Men, but that many of them went away\\nabout that Time, for the Coast of _Brazil_ and _Guinea_; others settled and\\nfortified themselves at _Madagascar, Mauritius, Johanna_ and _Mohilla_: And\\nthat others under _Conden_, in a Ship called the _Dragon_, took a large\\n_Moor_'s Vessel, coming from _Iudda_ and _Mocho_, with thirteen Lackies of\\nRupees on Board, (_i. e._ 1300000 half Crowns,) who having divided the\\nPlunder, burnt their Ship and Prize, and sat down quietly with their other\\nFriends at _Madagascar_.\\n\\nThe Account contain'd several other Things which we have before\\nrelated.--Commadore _Matthews_, upon receiving this Intelligence, and being\\nfond of the Service he came out for, hastened to those Islands, as the most\\nhopeful Places of Success; at St. _Mary_'s would have engaged _England_\\nwith Promises of Favour, if he would communicate what he knew, concerning\\nthe _Cassandra_, and the rest of the Pyrates, and assist in the Pilotage;\\nbut _England_ was wary, and thought this was to _surrender at Discretion_,\\nso they took up the _Judda_ Ship's Guns that was burnt, and the Men of War\\ndispersed themselves on several Voyages and Cruises afterwards, as was\\nthought likeliest to succeed, tho' to no Purpose: Then the Squadron went\\ndown to _Bombay_, were saluted by the Fort, and came home.\\n\\nThe Pyrates, I mean those of the _Cassandra_, now Captain _Taylor_, fitted\\nthe _Portuguese_ Man of War, and resolved upon another Voyage to the\\n_Indies_, notwithstanding the Riches they had heaped up; but as they were\\npreparing to sail, they heard of the four Men of War coming after them to\\nthose Seas, therefore they altered their Minds, sail'd for the Main of\\n_Africa_, and put in at a little Place called _Delagoa_, near the River _de\\nSpiritu Sancto_, on the Coast of _Monomotapa_, in 26° South Latitude. They\\nbelieved this to be a Place of Security, in regard that the Squadron could\\nnot possibly get Intelligence of them, there being no Correspondence over\\nLand, nor any Trade carried on by Sea, between that and the Cape, where the\\nMen of War were then supposed to be. The Pyrates came to in the Evening,\\nand were surprized with a few Shot from the Shore, not knowing of any\\nFortification or _European_ Settlement in that Part of the World; so they\\nanchored at a Distance that Night, and perceiving, in the Morning, a small\\nFort of six Guns, they run up to it, and battered it down.\\n\\nThis Fort was built and settled by the _Dutch East-India_ Company, a few\\nMonths before, for what Purpose, I know not, and having left 150 Men upon\\nthe Place, they were then dwindled to a third Part by Sickness and\\nCasualties, and never after received any Relief or Necessaries; so that\\nSixteen of those that were left, upon their humble Petition, were admitted\\non Board the Pyrates, and all the rest would have had the same Favour (they\\nsaid) had they been any other than _Dutch_. I mention this, as an Instance\\nof their Ingratitude, who had been so much obliged to their Countrymen for\\nSupport.\\n\\nHere they staid above four Months, carreened both their Ships, and took\\ntheir Diversions with Security, till they had expended all their\\nProvisions, and then put to Sea, leaving considerable Quantities of\\nMuslins, Chintzes, and such Goods behind, to the half starved _Dutch_ Men,\\nwhich enabled them to make good Pennyworths to the next that came, to whom\\nthey bartered for Provisions, at the Rate of three Farthings an _English_\\nYard.\\n\\nThey left _Delagoa_ the latter End of _December_ 1722, but not agreeing\\nwhere, or how to proceed, they concluded to part, so those who were for\\ncontinuing that sort of Life, went on Board the _Portuguese_ Prize, and\\nsteered for _Madagascar_ to their Friends, with whom I hear they are now\\nsettled; and the rest took the _Cassandra_ and sailed for the _Spanish\\nWest-Indies_. The _Mermaid_ Man of War happening then to be down on the\\nMain with a Convoy, about 30 Leagues from these Pyrates, would have gone\\nand attacked them; but on a Consultation of the Masters, whose Safety he\\nwas particularly to regard, they agreed their own Protection was of more\\nService than destroying the Pyrate, and so the Commander was unwillingly\\nwithheld. He dispatched a Sloop to _Jamaica_, with the News, which brought\\ndown the _Lanceston_, only a Day, or two, too late, they having just before\\nhe came, surrendered with all their Riches, to the Governor of _Porto\\nBello_.\\n\\nHere they sate down to spend the Fruits of their dishonest Industry,\\ndividing the Spoil and Plunder of Nations among themselves, without the\\nleast Remorse or Compunction, satisfying their Conscience with this Salvo,\\nthat other People would have done as much, had they the like Opportunities.\\nI can't say, but that if they had known what was doing in _England_, at the\\nsame Time by the _South-Sea_ Directors, and their Directors, they would\\ncertainly have had this Reflection for their Consolation, _viz. That what\\never Robberies they had committed, they might be pretty sure they were not\\nthe greatest Villains then living in the World_.\\n\\nIt is a difficult Matter to make a Computation of the Mischief that was\\ndone by this Crew, in about five Years Time, which is much more than the\\nPlunder they gained, for they often sunk or burnt the Vessel they took, as\\nit suited their Humour or Circumstances, sometimes to prevent giving\\nIntelligence, sometimes because they did not leave Men to navigate them,\\nand at other Times out of Wantonness, or because they were displeased at\\nthe Master's Behaviour; for any of these, it was but to give the Word, and\\ndown went Ships and Cargoes to the Bottom of the Sea.\\n\\nSince their Surrender to the _Spaniards_, I am informed several of them\\nhave left the Place, and dispersed themselves elsewhere; eight of them were\\nshipp'd about _November_ last, in one of the _South-Sea_ Company's Assiento\\nSloops, and passed for Ship-wreck'd Men, came to _Jamaica_, and there\\nsailed in other Vessels; and I know one of them that came to _England_ this\\nSpring from that Island. 'Tis said that Captain _Taylor_ has taken a\\nCommission in the _Spanish_ Service, and commanded the Man of War that\\nlately attack'd the _English_ Log-Wood Cutters, in the Bay of _Honduras_.\\n\\nCHAP. VI. OF Captain _Charles Vane_, And his CREW.\\n\\nC_Harles Vane_ was one of those who stole away the Silver which the\\n_Spaniards_ had fished up from the Wrecks of the Galleons, in the Gulph of\\n_Florida_, and was at _Providence_ (as has been before hinted) when\\nGovernor _Rogers_ arrived there with two Men of War.\\n\\nAll the Pyrates who were found at this Colony of Rogues, submitted, and\\nreceived Certificates of their Pardon, except Captain _Vane_ and his Crew;\\nwho, as soon as they saw the Men of War enter, slipp'd their Cable, set\\nFire to a Prize they had in the Harbour, and sailed out with their\\npyratical Colours flying, firing at one of the Men of War as they went off.\\n\\nTwo Days after they went out, they met with a Sloop belonging to\\n_Barbadoes_, which they made Prize of, and kept the Vessel for their own\\nUse, putting aboard five and twenty Hands, with one _Yeats_ to command\\nthem. A Day or two afterwards they fell in with a small interloping Trader,\\nwith a Quantity of _Spanish_ Pieces of Eight aboard, bound into\\n_Providence_, called the _John_ and _Elizabeth_, which they also took along\\nwith them. With these two Sloops _Vane_ went to a small Island and cleaned;\\nwhere they shared their Booty, and spent some Time in a riotous Manner of\\nLiving, as is the Custom of Pyrates.\\n\\nThe latter End of _May_ 1718, they sail'd, and being in want of Provisions,\\nthey beat up for the Windward Islands, and met with a _Spanish_ Sloop bound\\nfrom _Porto Rico_ to the _Havana_, which they burnt, and stowed the\\n_Spaniards_ in a Boat, and left them to get to the Island, by the Light of\\ntheir Vessel. But steering between St. _Christopher_'s and _Anguilla_, they\\nfell in with a Brigantine and a Sloop, with the Cargo they wanted; from\\nwhom they got Provisions for Sea-Store.\\n\\nSometime after this, standing to the Northward, in the Track the\\n_Old-England_ Ships take, in their Voyage to the _American_ Colonies, they\\ntook several Ships and Vessels, which they plundered of what they thought\\nfit, and let them pass.\\n\\nThe latter End of _August, Vane_, with his Consort _Yeats_, came off\\n_South-Carolina_, and took a Ship belonging to _Ipswich_, one _Coggershall_\\nCommander, laden with Logwood, which was thought convenient enough for\\ntheir own Business, and therefore ordered their Prisoners to work, and\\nthrow all the Lading over-board; but when they had more than half cleared\\nthe Ship, the Whim changed, and then they would not have her; so\\n_Coggershall_ had his Ship again, and he was suffered to pursue his Voyage\\nhome. In this Cruize the Rover took several other Ships and Vessels,\\nparticularly a Sloop from _Barbadoes, Dill_ Master; a small Ship from\\n_Antegoa, Cock_ Master; a Sloop belonging to _Curacco, Richards_ Master;\\nand a large Brigantine, Captain _Thompson_, from _Guiney_, with ninety odd\\nNegroes aboard. The Pyrates plundered them all and let them go, putting the\\nNegroes out of the Brigantine aboard of _Yeat_'s Vessel, by which Means\\nthey came back again to the right Owners.\\n\\nFor Captain _Vane_, having always treated his Consort with very little\\nRespect, assuming a Superiority over _Yeats_ and his small Crew, and\\nregarding the Vessel but as a Tender to his own; gave them a Disgust, who\\nthought themselves as good Pyrates, and as great Rogues as the best of\\nthem; so they caball'd together, and resolved to take the first Opportunity\\nto leave the Company; and accept of his Majesty's Pardon, or set up for\\nthemselves, either of which they thought more honourable than to be\\nServants to the former; and the putting aboard so many Negroes, where they\\nfound so few Hands to take Care of them, still aggravated the Matter,\\nthough they thought fit to conceal or stifle their Resentments at that\\nTime.\\n\\nA Day or two afterwards, the Pyrates lying off at Anchor, _Yeats_ in the\\nEvening slipp'd his Cable, and put his Vessel under Sail, standing into the\\nShore; which, when _Vane_ saw, he was highly provoked, and got his Sloop\\nunder Sail to chase his Consort, who, he plainly perceived, had a Mind to\\nhave no further Affairs with him: _Vane_'s Brigantine sailing best, he\\ngained Ground of _Yeats_, and would certainly have come up with him, had he\\nhad a little longer Run for it; but just as he got over the Bar, when\\n_Vane_ came within Gun-shot of him, he fired a Broadside at his old Friend,\\n(which did him no Damage,) and so took his Leave.\\n\\n_Yeats_ came into _North Edisto_ River, about ten Leagues Southward of\\n_Charles-Town_, and sent an Express to the Governor, to know if he and his\\nComrades might have the Benefit of his Majesty's Pardon, and they would\\nsurrender themselves to his Mercy, with the Sloops and Negroes; which being\\ngranted, they all came up and received Certificates; and Captain\\n_Thompson_, from whom the Negroes were taken, had them restored to him, for\\nthe Use of his Owners.\\n\\n_Vane_ cruised some Time off the Bar, in hopes to catch _Yeats_ at his\\ncoming out again, but therein he was disappointed; however, he\\nunfortunately for them, took two Ships from _Charles-Town_, bound home to\\n_England_. It happen'd that just at this Time two Sloops well mann'd and\\narm'd, were equipp'd to go after a Pyrate, which the Governor of\\n_South-Carolina_ was informed, lay then in Cape _Fear_ River, a cleaning:\\nBut Colonel _Rhet_, who commanded the Sloops, meeting with one of the Ships\\nthat _Vane_ had plundered, going back over the Bar, for such Necessaries as\\nhad been taken from her, and she giving the Colonel an Account of her being\\ntaken by the Pyrate _Vane_, and also, that some of her Men, while they were\\nPrisoners on Board of him, had heard the Pyrates say, they should clean in\\none of the Rivers to the Southward; he altered his first Design, and\\ninstead of standing to the Northward, in pursuit of the Pyrate in Cape\\n_Fear_ River, he turns to the Southward after _Vane_; who had ordered such\\nReports to be given out, on purpose to send any Force that should come\\nafter him, upon a wrong Scent; for in Reality he stood away to the\\nNorthward, so that the Pursuit proved to be the contrary Way.\\n\\nColonel _Rhet_'s speaking with this Ship, was the most unlucky Thing that\\ncould have happened, because it turned him out of the Road, which in all\\nProbability, would have brought him into the Company of _Vane_, as well as\\nof the Pyrate he went after; and so they might have been both destroy'd;\\nwhereas, by the Colonel's going a different Way, he not only lost the\\nOpportunity of meeting with one, but if the other had not been infatuated,\\nto lye six Weeks together at Cape _Fear_, he would have missed of him\\nlikewise: However, the Colonel having searched the Rivers and Inlets, as\\ndirected, for several Days, without Success, at length sailed in\\nProsecution of his first Design, and met with the Pyrate accordingly, whom\\nhe fought and took, as has been before spoken of, in the History of Major\\n_Bonnet_.\\n\\nCaptain _Vane_ went into an Inlet to the Northward, where he met with\\nCaptain _Thatch_, or _Teach_, otherwise call'd _Black-beard_, whom he\\nsaluted (when he found who he was) with his great Guns, loaded with Shot,\\n(as is the Custom among Pyrates when they meet) which are fired wide, or up\\ninto the Air: _Black-beard_ answered the Salute in the same Manner, and\\nmutual Civilities passed for some Days; when about the Beginning of\\n_October, Vane_ took Leave, and sailed further to the Northward.\\n\\nOn the 23d of _October_, off of _Long Island_, he took a small Brigantine,\\nbound from _Jamaica_ to _Salem_ in _New-England, John Shattock_ Master, and\\na little Sloop; they rifled the Brigantine, and sent her away. From hence\\nthey resolved on a Cruize between Cape _Meise_ and Cape _Nicholas_, where\\nthey spent some Time, without seeing or speaking with any Vessel, till the\\nlatter End of _November_; then they fell upon a Ship, which 'twas expected\\nwould have struck as soon as their black Colours were hoisted; but instead\\nof that, she discharged a Broadside upon the Pyrate, and hoisted Colours,\\nwhich shewed her to be a _French_ Man of War. _Vane_ desired to have\\nnothing further to say to her, but trimm'd his Sails, and stood away from\\nthe _French_ Man; but _Monsieur_ having a Mind to be better informed who he\\nwas, set all his Sails, and crowded after him. During this Chace, the\\nPyrates were divided in their Resolutions what to do: _Vane_, the Captain,\\nwas for making off as fast as he could, alledging the Man of War was too\\nstrong to cope with; but one _John Rackam_, who was an Officer, that had a\\nkind of a Check upon the Captain, rose up in Defence of a contrary Opinion,\\nsaying, _That tho' she had more Guns, and a greater Weight of Mettal, they\\nmight board her, and then the best Boys would carry the Day. Rackam_ was\\nwell seconded, and the Majority was for boarding; but _Vane_ urged, _That\\nit was too rash and desperate an Enterprize, the Man of War appearing to be\\ntwice their Force; and that their Brigantine might be sunk by her before\\nthey could reach on board_. The Mate, one _Robert Deal_, was of _Vane_'s\\nOpinion, as were about fifteen more, and all the rest joined with _Rackam_,\\nthe Quarter-Master. At length the Captain made use of his Power to\\ndetermine this Dispute, which, in these Cases, is absolute and\\nuncontroulable, by their own Laws, _viz_. in _fighting, chasing_, or _being\\nchased_; in all other Matters whatsoever, he is governed by a Majority; so\\nthe Brigantine having the Heels, as they term it, of the _French_ Man, she\\ncame clear off.\\n\\nBut the next Day, the Captain's Behaviour was obliged to stand the Test of\\na Vote, and a Resolution passed against his Honour and Dignity, branding\\nhim with the Name of Coward, deposing him from the Command, and turning him\\nout of the Company, with Marks of Infamy; and, with him, went all those who\\ndid not Vote for boarding the _French_ Man of War. They had with them a\\nsmall Sloop that had been taken by them some Time before, which they gave\\nto _Vane_, and the discarded Members; and, that they might be in a\\nCondition to provide for themselves, by their own honest Endeavours, they\\nlet them have a sufficient Quantity of Provisions and Ammunition along with\\nthem.\\n\\n_John Rackam_ was voted Captain of the Brigantine, in _Vane_'s Room, and\\nproceeded towards the _Caribbee Islands_, where we must leave him, till we\\nhave finished our Story of _Charles Vane_.\\n\\nThe Sloop sailed for the Bay of _Honduras_, and _Vane_ and his Crew put her\\ninto as good a Condition as they could by the Way, to follow the old Trade.\\nThey cruised two or three Days off the North-West Part of _Jamaica_, and\\ntook a Sloop and two Pettiagas, and all the Men entered with them; the\\nSloop they kept, and _Robert Deal_ went Captain of her.\\n\\nOn the 16th of _December_ the two Sloops came into the Bay, where they\\nfound only one at an Anchor, call'd the _Pearl_, of _Jamaica_, Captain\\n_Charles Rowling_ Master, who got under Sail at the Sight of them; but the\\nPyrate Sloops coming near _Rowling_, and shewing no Colours, he gave them a\\nGun or two; whereupon they hoisted the black Flag, and fired three Guns\\neach, at the _Pearl_; she struck, and the Pyrates took Possession, and\\ncarried her away to a small Island called _Barnacko_, and there they\\ncleaned, meeting in the Way with a Sloop from _Jamaica_, Captain _Wallden_\\nCommander, going down to the Bay, which they also made Prize of.\\n\\nIn _February, Vane_ sailed from _Barnacko_, in order for a Cruize; but some\\nDays after he was out, a violent Turnado overtook him, which separated him\\nfrom his Consort, and after two Days Distress, threw his Sloop upon a small\\nuninhabited Island, near the Bay of _Honduras_, where she was staved to\\nPieces, and most of her Men drowned: _Vane_ himself was saved, but reduced\\nto great Streights, for want of Necessaries, having no Opportunity to get\\nany Thing from the Wreck. He lived here some Weeks, and was subsisted\\nchiefly by Fishermen, who frequented the Island with small Craft, from the\\nMain, to catch Turtles, _&c_.\\n\\nWhile _Vane_ was upon this Island, a Ship put in from _Jamaica_ for Water,\\nthe Captain of which, one _Holford_, an old Buccaneer, happened to be\\n_Vane_'s Acquaintance; he thought this a good Opportunity to get off, and\\naccordingly applied to his old Friend; but he absolutely refused him,\\nsaying to him, Charles, _I shan't trust you aboard my Ship, unless I carry\\nyou a Prisoner; for I shall have you caballing with my Men, knock me on the\\nHead, and run away with my Ship a pyrating. Vane_ made all the\\nProtestations of Honour in the World to him; but, it seems, Captain\\n_Holford_ was too intimately acquainted with him, to repose any Confidence\\nat all in his Words or Oaths. He told him, _He might easily find a Way to\\nget off, if he had a Mind to it: I am now going down the Bay_, says he,\\n_and shall return hither, in about a Month; and if I find you upon the\\nIsland when I come back, I'll carry you to_ Jamaica, _and hang you. Which\\nWay can I get away_? Answers _Vane. Are there not Fishermen's Dories upon\\nthe Beach? Can't you take one of them_? Replies _Holford. What_, says\\n_Vane, would you have me steal a Dory then? Do you make it a Matter of\\nConscience_? Said _Holford, to steal a Dory, when you have been a common\\nRobber and Pyrate, stealing Ships and Cargoes, and plundering all Mankind\\nthat fell in your Way? Stay there, and be d--n'd, if you are so Squeamish_:\\nAnd so left him.\\n\\nAfter Captain _Holford_'s Departure, another Ship put in to the same Island\\nin her Way home for Water; none of whose Company knowing _Vane_, he easily\\npassed upon them for another Man, and so was shipp'd for the Voyage. One\\nwould be apt to think that _Vane_ was now pretty safe, and likely to escape\\nthe Fate which his Crimes had merited; but here a cross Accident happen'd\\nthat ruin'd all: _Holford_, returning from the Bay, was met with by this\\nShip; the Captains being very well acquainted together, _Holford_ was\\ninvited to dine aboard of him, which he did; and as he passed along to the\\nCabin, he chanced to cast his Eye down the Hold, and there saw _Charles\\nVane_ at work; he immediately spoke to the Captain, saying, _Do you know\\nwho you have got aboard here? Why_, says he, _I have shipp'd a Man at such\\nan Island, who was cast away in a trading Sloop, he seems to be a brisk\\nHand. I tell you_, says Captain _Holford, it is_ Vane _the notorious\\nPyrate. If it be him_, replies the other, _I won't keep him: Why then_,\\nsays _Holford, I'll send and take him aboard, and surrender him at_\\nJamaica. Which being agreed to, Captain _Holford_, as soon as he returned\\nto his Ship, sent his Boat with his Mate armed, who coming to _Vane_,\\nshewed him a Pistol, and told him, _He was his Prisoner_; which none\\nopposing, he was brought aboard, and put in Irons; and when Captain\\n_Holford_ arrived at _Jamaica_, he delivered his old Acquaintance into the\\nHands of Justice; at which Place he was try'd, convicted, and executed, as\\nwas, some Time before, _Vane_'s Consort, _Robert Deal_, brought thither by\\none of the Men of War.\\n\\nCHAP. VII. OF Captain _John Rackam_, And his CREW.\\n\\nTHIS _John Rackam_, as has been mentioned in the last Chapter, was\\nQuarter-Master to _Vane_'s Company, till they were divided, and _Vane_\\nturned out for refusing to board and fight the _French_ Man of War; then\\n_Rackam_ was voted Captain of that Division that remained in the\\nBrigantine. The 24th of _November_ 1718, was the first Day of his Command,\\nand his first Cruize was among the _Caribbee Islands_, where he took and\\nplunder'd several Vessels.\\n\\nWe have already taken Notice, that when Captain _Woodes Rogers_ went to the\\nIsland of _Providence_, with the King's Pardon to such as should surrender,\\nthis Brigantine, which _Rackam_ now commanded, made its Escape, thro'\\nanother Passage, bidding Defiance to Mercy.\\n\\nTo Windward of _Jamaica_, a _Madera_ Man fell into the Pyrates Way, which\\nthey detained two or three Days, till they had made their Market out of\\nher, and then gave her back to the Master, and permitted one _Hosea\\nTisdell_, a Tavern-Keeper at _Jamaica_, who had been pick'd up in one of\\ntheir Prizes, to depart in her, she being then bound for that Island.\\n\\nAfter this Cruize, they went into a small Island and cleaned, and spent\\ntheir _Christmas_ ashore, drinking and carousing as long as they had any\\nLiquor left, and then went to Sea again for more, where they succeeded but\\ntoo well, though they took no extraordinary Prize, for above two Months,\\nexcept a Ship laden with Thieves from _Newgate_, bound for the Plantations,\\nwhich, in a few Days, was retaken with all her Cargo, by an _English_ Man\\nof War.\\n\\n_Rackam_ stood off towards the Island of _Burmudas_, and took a Ship bound\\nto _England_ from _Carolina_, and a small Pink from _New-England_, and\\nbrought them to the _Bahama_ Islands, where with the Pitch, Tar, and\\nStores, they clean'd again, and refitted their own Vessel; but staying too\\nlong in that Neighbourhood, Captain _Rogers_, who was Governor of\\n_Providence_, hearing of these Ships being taken, sent out a Sloop well\\nmann'd and arm'd, which retook both the Prizes, and in the mean while the\\nPyrate had the good Fortune to escape.\\n\\nFrom hence they sailed to the Back of _Cuba_, where _Rackam_ kept a little\\nkind of a Family, at which Place, they staid a considerable Time, living\\nashore with their Dalilahs, till their Money and Provision were expended,\\nand then they concluded it Time to look out: They repaired to their Vessel,\\nand was making ready to put Sea, when a _Guarda del Costa_ came in with a\\nsmall _English_ Sloop, which she had taken as an Interloper on the Coast.\\nThe _Spanish_ Guardship attack'd the Pyrate, but _Rackam_ being close in\\nbehind a little Island, she could do but little Execution where she lay,\\ntherefore the _Spaniard_ warps into the Channel that Evening, in order to\\nmake sure of her the next Morning. _Rackam_ finding his Case desperate, and\\nhardly any Possibility of escaping, resolved to attempt the following\\nEnterprize: The _Spanish_ Prize lying for better Security close into the\\nLand, between the little Island and the Main; _Rackam_ takes his Crew into\\nthe Boat, with their Pistols and Cutlashes, rounds the little Island, and\\nfalls aboard their Prize silently in the dead of the Night, without being\\ndiscovered, telling the _Spaniards_ that were aboard of her, that if they\\nspoke a Word, or made the least Noise, they were dead Men, and so became\\nMaster of her; when this was done, he slipt her Cable, and drove out to\\nSea: The _Spanish_ Man of War, was so intent upon their expected Prize,\\nthat they minded nothing else, and assoon as Day broke, made a furious Fire\\nupon the empty Sloop, but it was not long before they were rightly apprized\\nof the Matter, and cursed themselves for Fools, to be bit out of a good\\nrich Prize, as she prov'd to be, and to have nothing but an old crazy Hull\\nin the room of her.\\n\\n_Rackam_ and his Crew had no Occasion to be displeased at the Exchange,\\nthat enabled them to continue some Time longer in a Way of Life that suited\\ntheir depraved Tempers: In _August_ 1720, we find him at Sea again,\\nscouring the Harbours and Inlets of the North and West Parts of _Jamaica_,\\nwhere he took several small Craft, which proved no great Booty to the\\nRovers, but they had but few Men, and therefore they were obliged to run at\\nlow Game, till they could encrease their Company.\\n\\nIn the Beginning of _September_, they took seven or eight Fishing-Boats in\\n_Harbour Island_, stole their Nets and other Tackle, and then went off the\\n_French_ Part of _Hispaniola_, and landed, and took Cattle away, with two\\nor three _French_ Men they found near the Water-Side, hunting of wild Hogs\\nin the Evening: The _French_ Men came on Board, whether by Consent or\\nCompulsion, I can't say. They afterwards plundered two Sloops, and returned\\nto _Jamaica_, on the North Coast of which Island, near _Porto Maria_ Bay,\\nthey took a Scooner, _Thomas Spenlow_ Master; it was then the 19th of\\n_October_. The next Day, _Rackam_ seeing a Sloop in _Dry Harbour_ Bay, he\\nstood in and fired a Gun; the Men all run ashore, and he took the Sloop and\\nLading, but when those ashore found them to be Pyrates, they hailed the\\nSloop, and let them know they were all willing to come aboard of them.\\n\\n_Rackam_'s coasting the Island in this Manner, proved fatal to him, for\\nIntelligence came to the Governor, of his Expedition, by a Canoa which he\\nhad surprized ashore, in _Ocho_ Bay; upon which a Sloop was immediately\\nfitted out, and sent round the Island in quest of him, commanded by Captain\\n_Barnet_, with a good Number of Hands. _Rackam_ rounding the Island, and\\ndrawing near the Westermost Point, called Point _Negril_, saw a small\\nPettiauger, which at sight of the Sloop, run ashore and landed her Men;\\nwhen one of them hailed her, Answer was made, _They were_ English _Men_,\\nand desired the Pettiauger's Men to come on Board, and drink a Bowl of\\nPunch, which they were prevailed upon to do; accordingly the Company came\\nall aboard of the Pyrate, consisting of nine Persons, in an ill Hour; they\\nwere armed with Muskets and Cutlashes, but, what was their real Design by\\nso doing, I shall not take upon me to say; but they had no sooner laid down\\ntheir Arms, and taken up their Pipes, but _Barnet_'s Sloop, which was in\\nPursuit of _Rackam_'s, came in Sight.\\n\\nThe Pyrates finding she stood directly towards her, fear'd the Event, and\\nweighed their Anchor, which they but lately let go, and stood off: Captain\\n_Barnet_ gave them Chace, and having the Advantage of little Breezes of\\nWind, which blew off the Land, came up with her, and, after a very small\\nDispute, took her, and brought her into _Port Royal_, in _Jamaica_.\\n\\nIn about a Fortnight after the Prisoners were brought ashore, _viz.\\nNovember_ 16, 1720, a Court of Admiralty was held at St. _Jago de la Vega_,\\nbefore which the following Persons were convicted, and Sentence of Death\\npassed upon them, by the President, Sir _Nicholas Laws, viz. John Rackam_\\nCaptain, _George Fetherston_ Master, _Richard Corner_ Quarter-Master, _John\\nDavis, John Howell, Patrick Carty, Thomas Earl, James Dobbin_ and _Noah\\nHarwood_. The five first were executed the next Day at _Gallows Point_, at\\nthe Town of _Port Royal_, and the rest, the Day after, at _Kingston_;\\n_Rackam, Feverston_ and _Corner_, were afterwards taken down and hang'd up\\nin Chains, one at _Plumb Point_, one at _Bush Key_, and the other at _Gun\\nKey_.\\n\\nBut what was very surprizing, was, the Conviction of the nine Men that came\\naboard the Sloop the same Day she was taken. They were try'd at an\\nAdjournment of the Court, on the 24th of _January_, waiting all that Time,\\nit is supposed, for Evidence, to prove the pyratical Intention of going\\naboard the said Sloop; for it seems there was no Act of Pyracy committed by\\nthem, after their coming on Board, as appeared by the Witnesses against\\nthem, who were two _French_ Men taken by _Rackam_, off from the Island of\\n_Hispaniola_, and deposed in the following Manner.\\n\\n   `That the Prisoners at the Bar, _viz. John Eaton,\\n   Edward Warner, Thomas Baker, Thomas Quick, John Cole,\\n   Benjamin Palmer, Walter Rouse, John Hanson_, and _John\\n   Howard_, came aboard the Pyrate's Sloop at _Negril\\n   Point, Rackam_ sending his Canoe ashore for that\\n   Purpose: That they brought Guns and Cutlashes on Board\\n   with them: That when Captain\\n   _Barnet_ chased them, some were drinking, and others\\n   walking the Deck: That there was a great Gun and a\\n   small Arm fired by the Pyrate Sloop, at Captain\\n   _Barnet_'s Sloop, when he chased her; and that when\\n   Captain _Barnet_'s Sloop fired at _Rackam_'s Sloop, the\\n   Prisoners at the Bar went down under Deck. That during\\n   the Time Captain _Barnet_ chased them, some of the\\n   Prisoners at the Bar (but which of them he could not\\n   tell) helped to row the Sloop, in order to escape from\\n   _Barnet_: That they all seemed to be consorted\\n   together.\\n\\nThis was the Substance of all that was evidenced against them, the\\nPrisoners answered in their Defence,\\n\\n   `That they had no Witnesses: That they had bought a\\n   Pettiauger in order to go a Turtleing; and being at\\n   _Negril Point_, and just got ashore, they saw a Sloop\\n   with a white Pendant coming towards them, upon which\\n   they took their Arms, and hid themselves in the Bushes:\\n   That one of them hail'd the Sloop, who answer'd, _They\\n   were_ English _Men_, and desired them to come aboard\\n   and drink a Bowl of Punch; which they at first refused,\\n   but afterwards with much perswasion, they went on\\n   Board, in the Sloop's Canoe, and left their own\\n   Pettiauger at Anchor: That they had been but a short\\n   Time on Board, when Captain _Barnet_'s Sloop heaved in\\n   Sight: That _Rackam_ ordered them to help to weigh the\\n   Sloop's Anchor immediately, which they all refused:\\n   That _Rackam_ used violent Means to oblige them; and\\n   that when Captain _Barnet_ came up with them, they all\\n   readily and willingly submitted.\\n\\nWhen the Prisoners were taken from the Bar, and the Persons present being\\nwithdrawn, the Court considered the Prisoners Cases, and the Majority of\\nthe Commissioners being of Opinion, that they were all Guilty of the Pyracy\\nand Felony they were charged with, which was, _the going over with a\\npyratical and felonious Intent to_ John Rackam, &c. _then notorious\\nPyrates, and by them known to be so_, they all received Sentence of Death;\\nwhich every Body must allow proved somewhat unlucky to the poor Fellows.\\n\\nOn the 17th of _February, John Eaton, Thomas Quick_ and _Thomas Baker_,\\nwere executed at _Gallows Point_, at _Port Royal_, and the next Day _John\\nCole, John Howard_ and _Benjamin Palmer_, were executed at _Kingston_;\\nwhether the other three were executed afterwards, or not, I never heard.\\n\\nTwo other Pyrates were try'd that belonged to _Rackam_'s Crew, and being\\nconvicted, were brought up, and asked if either of them had any Thing to\\nsay why Sentence of Death should not pass upon them, in like Manner as had\\nbeen done to all the rest; and both of them pleaded their Bellies, being\\nquick with Child, and pray'd that Execution might be stay'd, whereupon the\\nCourt passed Sentence, as in Cases of Pyracy, but ordered them back, till a\\nproper Jury should be appointed to enquire into the Matter.\\n\\n_The_ LIFE _of_ MARY READ,\\n\\nNOW we are to begin a History full of surprizing Turns and\\nAdventures; I mean, that of _Mary Read_ and _Anne Bonny_, alias _Bonn_,\\nwhich were the true Names of these two Pyrates; the odd Incidents of their\\nrambling Lives are such, that some may be tempted to think the whole Story\\nno better than a Novel or Romance; but since it is supported by many\\nthousand Witnesses, I mean the People of _Jamaica_, who were present at\\ntheir Tryals, and heard the Story of their Lives, upon the first discovery\\nof their Sex; the Truth of it can be no more contested, than that there\\nwere such Men in the World, as _Roberts_ and _Black-beard_, who were\\nPyrates.\\n\\n_Mary Read_ was born in _England_, her Mother was married young, to a Man\\nwho used the Sea, who going a Voyage soon after their Marriage, left her\\nwith Child, which Child proved to be a Boy. As to the Husband, whether he\\nwas cast away, or died in the Voyage, _Mary Read_ could not tell; but\\nhowever, he never returned more; nevertheless, the Mother, who was young\\nand airy, met with an Accident, which has often happened to Women who are\\nyoung, and do not take a great deal of Care; which was, she soon proved\\nwith Child again, without a Husband to Father it, but how, or by whom, none\\nbut her self could tell, for she carried a pretty good Reputation among her\\nNeighbours. Finding her Burthen grow, in order to conceal her Shame, she\\ntakes a formal Leave of her Husband's Relations, giving out, that she went\\nto live with some Friends of her own, in the Country: Accordingly she went\\naway, and carried with her her young Son, at this Time, not a Year old:\\nSoon after her Departure her Son died, but Providence in Return, was\\npleased to give her a Girl in his Room, of which she was safely delivered,\\nin her Retreat, and this was our _Mary Read_.\\n\\nHere the Mother liv'd three or four Years, till what Money she had was\\nalmost gone; then she thought of returning to _London_, and considering\\nthat her Husband's Mother was in some Circumstances, she did not doubt but\\nto prevail upon her, to provide for the Child, if she could but pass it\\nupon her for the same, but the changing a Girl into a Boy, seem'd a\\ndifficult Piece of Work, and how to deceive an experienced old Woman, in\\nsuch a Point, was altogether as impossible; however, she ventured to dress\\nit up as a Boy, brought it to Town, and presented it to her Mother in Law,\\nas her Husband's Son; the old Woman would have taken it, to have bred it\\nup, but the Mother pretended it would break her Heart, to part with it; so\\nit was agreed betwixt them, that the Child should live with the Mother, and\\nthe supposed Grandmother should allow a Crown a Week for it's Maintainance.\\n\\nThus the Mother gained her Point, she bred up her Daughter as a Boy, and\\nwhen she grew up to some Sense, she thought proper to let her into the\\nSecret of her Birth, to induce her to conceal her Sex. It happen'd that the\\nGrandmother died, by which Means the Subsistance that came from that\\nQuarter, ceased, and they were more and more reduced in their\\nCircumstances; wherefore she was obliged to put her Daughter out, to wait\\non a _French_ Lady, as a Foot-boy, being now thirteen Years of Age: Here\\nshe did not live long, for growing bold and strong, and having also a\\nroving Mind, she entered her self on Board a Man of War, where she served\\nsome Time, then quitted it, went over into _Flanders_, and carried Arms in\\na Regiment of Foot, as a _Cadet_; and tho' upon all Actions, she behaved\\nherself with a great deal of Bravery, yet she could not get a Commission,\\nthey being generally bought and sold; therefore she quitted the Service,\\nand took on in a Regiment of Horse; she behaved so well in several\\nEngagements, that she got the Esteem of all her Officers; but her Comrade\\nwho was a _Fleming_, happening to be a handsome young Fellow, she falls in\\nLove with him, and from that Time, grew a little more negligent in her\\nDuty, so that, it seems, _Mars_ and _Venus_ could not be served at the same\\nTime; her Arms and Accoutrements which were always kept in the best Order,\\nwere quite neglected: 'tis true, when her Comrade was ordered out upon a\\nParty, she used to go without being commanded, and frequently run herself\\ninto Danger, where she had no Business, only to be near him; the rest of\\nthe Troopers little suspecting the secret Cause which moved her to this\\nBehaviour, fancied her to be mad, and her Comrade himself could not account\\nfor this strange Alteration in her, but Love is ingenious, and as they lay\\nin the same Tent, and were constantly together, she found a Way of letting\\nhim discover her Sex, without appearing that it was done with Design.\\n\\nHe was much surprized at what he found out, and not a little pleased,\\ntaking it for granted, that he should have a Mistress solely to himself,\\nwhich is an unusual Thing in a Camp, since there is scarce one of those\\nCampaign Ladies, that is ever true to a Troop or Company; so that he\\nthought of nothing but gratifying his Passions with very little Ceremony;\\nbut he found himself strangely mistaken, for she proved very reserved and\\nmodest, and resisted all his Temptations, and at the same Time was so\\nobliging and insinuating in her Carriage, that she quite changed his\\nPurpose, so far from thinking of making her his Mistress, he now courted\\nher for a Wife.\\n\\nThis was the utmost Wish of her Heart, in short, they exchanged Promises,\\nand when the Campaign was over, and the Regiment marched into Winter\\nQuarters, they bought Woman's Apparel for her, with such Money as they\\ncould make up betwixt them, and were publickly married.\\n\\nThe Story of two Troopers marrying each other, made a great Noise, so that\\nseveral Officers were drawn by Curiosity to assist at the Ceremony, and\\nthey agreed among themselves that every one of them should make a small\\nPresent to the Bride, towards House-keeping, in Consideration of her having\\nbeen their fellow Soldier. Thus being set up, they seemed to have a Desire\\nof quitting the Service, and settling in the World; the Adventure of their\\nLove and Marriage had gained them so much Favour, that they easily obtained\\ntheir Discharge, and they immediately set up an Eating House or Ordinary,\\nwhich was the Sign of the _Three Horse-Shoes_, near the Castle of _Breda_,\\nwhere they soon run into a good Trade, a great many Officers eating with\\nthem constantly.\\n\\nBut this Happiness lasted not long, for the Husband soon died, and the\\nPeace of _Reswick_ being concluded, there was no Resort of Officers to\\n_Breda_, as usual; so that the Widow having little or no Trade, was forced\\nto give up House-keeping, and her Substance being by Degrees quite spent,\\nshe again assumes her Man's Apparel, and going into _Holland_, there takes\\non in a Regiment of Foot, quarter'd in one of the Frontier Towns: Here she\\ndid not remain long, there was no likelihood of Preferment in Time of\\nPeace, therefore she took a Resolution of seeking her Fortune another Way;\\nand withdrawing from the Regiment, ships herself on Board of a Vessel bound\\nfor the _West-Indies_.\\n\\nIt happen'd this Ship was taken by _English_ Pyrates, and _Mary Read_ was\\nthe only _English_ Person on Board, they kept her amongst them, and having\\nplundered the Ship, let it go again; after following this Trade for some\\nTime, the King's Proclamation came out, and was publish'd in all Parts of\\nthe _West-Indies_, for pardoning such Pyrates, who should voluntarily\\nsurrender themselves by a certain Day therein mentioned. The Crew of _Mary\\nRead_ took the Benefit of this Proclamation, and having surrender'd, liv'd\\nquietly on Shore; but Money beginning to grow short, and hearing that\\nCaptain _Woods Rogers_, Governor of the Island of _Providence_, was fitting\\nout some Privateers to cruise against the _Spaniards_, she with several\\nothers embark'd for that Island, in order to go upon the privateering\\nAccount, being resolved to make her Fortune one way or other.\\n\\nThese Privateers were no sooner sail'd out, but the Crews of some of them,\\nwho had been pardoned, rose against their Commanders, and turned themselves\\nto their old Trade: In this Number was _Mary Read_. It is true, she often\\ndeclared, that the Life of a Pyrate was what she always abhor'd, and went\\ninto it only upon Compulsion, both this Time, and before, intending to quit\\nit, whenever a fair Opportunity should offer it self; yet some of the\\nEvidence against her, upon her Tryal, who were forced Men, and had sailed\\nwith her, deposed upon Oath, that in Times of Action, no Person amongst\\nthem were more resolute, or ready to Board or undertake any Thing that was\\nhazardous, as she and _Anne Bonny_; and particularly at the Time they were\\nattack'd and taken, when they came to close Quarters, none kept the Deck\\nexcept _Mary Read_ and _Anne Bonny_, and one more; upon which, she, _Mary\\nRead_, called to those under Deck, to come up and fight like Men, and\\nfinding they did not stir, fired her Arms down the Hold amongst them,\\nkilling one, and wounding others.\\n\\nThis was part of the Evidence against her, which she denied; which, whether\\ntrue or no, thus much is certain, that she did not want Bravery, nor indeed\\nwas she less remarkable for her Modesty, according to her Notions of\\nVirtue: Her Sex was not so much as suspected by any Person on Board, till\\n_Anne Bonny_, who was not altogether so reserved in point of Chastity, took\\na particular liking to her; in short, _Anne Bonny_ took her for a handsome\\nyoung Fellow, and for some Reasons best known to herself, first discovered\\nher Sex to _Mary Read; Mary Read_ knowing what she would be at, and being\\nvery sensible of her own Incapacity that Way, was forced to come to a right\\nUnderstanding with her, and so to the great Disappointment of _Anne Bonny_,\\nshe let her know she was a Woman also; but this Intimacy so disturb'd\\nCaptain _Rackam_, who was the Lover and Gallant of _Anne Bonny_, that he\\ngrew furiously jealous, so that he told _Anne Bonny_, he would cut her new\\nLover's Throat, therefore, to quiet him, she let him into the Secret also.\\n\\nCaptain _Rackam_, (as he was enjoined,) kept the Thing a Secret from all\\nthe Ship's Company, yet, notwithstanding all her Cunning and Reserve, Love\\nfound her out in this Disguise, and hinder'd her from forgetting her Sex.\\nIn their Cruize they took a great Number of Ships belonging to _Jamaica_,\\nand other Parts of the _West-Indies_, bound to and from _England_; and when\\never they meet any good Artist, or other Person that might be of any great\\nUse to their Company, if he was not willing to enter, it was their Custom\\nto keep him by Force. Among these was a young Fellow of a most engageing\\nBehaviour, or, at least, he was so in the Eyes of _Mary Read_, who became\\nso smitten with his Person and Address, that she could neither rest, Night\\nor Day; but as there is nothing more ingenious than Love, it was no hard\\nMatter for her, who had before been practiced in these Wiles, to find a Way\\nto let him discover her Sex: She first insinuated her self into his liking,\\nby talking against the Life of a Pyrate, which he was altogether averse to,\\nso they became Mess-Mates and strict Companions: When she found he had a\\nFriendship for her, as a Man, she suffered the Discovery to be made, by\\ncarelesly shewing her Breasts, which were very White.\\n\\nThe young Fellow, who was made of Flesh and Blood, had his Curiosity and\\nDesire so rais'd by this Sight, that he never ceased importuning her, till\\nshe confessed what she was. Now begins the Scene of Love; as he had a\\nLiking and Esteem for her, under her supposed Character, it was now turn'd\\ninto Fondness and Desire; her Passion was no less violent than his, and\\nperhaps she express'd it, by one of the most generous Actions that ever\\nLove inspired. It happened this young Fellow had a Quarrel with one of the\\nPyrates, and their Ship then lying at an Anchor, near one of the Islands,\\nthey had appointed to go ashore and fight, according to the Custom of the\\nPyrates: _Mary Read_, was to the last Degree uneasy and anxious, for the\\nFate of her Lover; she would not have had him refuse the Challenge,\\nbecause, she could not bear the Thoughts of his being branded with\\nCowardise; on the other Side, she dreaded the Event, and apprehended the\\nFellow might be too hard for him: When Love once enters into the Breast of\\none who has any Sparks of Generosity, it stirs the Heart up to the most\\nnoble Actions; in this Dilemma, she shew'd, that she fear'd more for his\\nLife than she did for her own; for she took a Resolution of quarreling with\\nthis Fellow her self, and having challenged him ashore, she appointed the\\nTime two Hours sooner than that when he was to meet her Lover, where she\\nfought him at Sword and Pistol, and killed him upon the Spot.\\n\\nIt is true, she had fought before, when she had been insulted by some of\\nthose Fellows, but now it was altogether in her Lover's Cause, she stood as\\nit were betwixt him and Death, as if she could not live without him. If he\\nhad no regard for her before, this Action would have bound him to her for\\never; but there was no Occasion for Ties or Obligations, his Inclination\\ntowards her was sufficient; in fine, they applied their Troth to each\\nother, which _Mary Read_ said, she look'd upon to be as good a Marriage, in\\nConscience, as if it had been done by a Minister in Church; and to this was\\nowing her great Belly, which she pleaded to save her Life.\\n\\nShe declared she had never committed Adultery or Fornication with any Man,\\nshe commended the Justice of the Court, before which she was tried, for\\ndistinguishing the Nature of their Crimes; her Husband, as she call'd him,\\nwith several others, being acquitted; and being ask'd, who he was? she\\nwould not tell, but, said he was an honest Man, and had no Inclination to\\nsuch Practices, and that they had both resolved to leave the Pyrates the\\nfirst Opportunity, and apply themselves to some honest Livelyhood.\\n\\nIt is no doubt, but many had Compassion for her, yet the Court could not\\navoid finding her Guilty; for among other Things, one of the Evidences\\nagainst her, deposed, that being taken by _Rackam_, and detain'd some Time\\non Board, he fell accidentally into Discourse with _Mary Read_, whom he\\ntaking for a young Man, ask'd her, what Pleasure she could have in being\\nconcerned in such Enterprizes, where her Life was continually in Danger, by\\nFire or Sword; and not only so, but she must be sure of dying an\\nignominious Death, if she should be taken alive?--She answer'd, that as to\\nhanging, she thought it no great Hardship, for, were it not for that, every\\ncowardly Fellow would turn Pyrate, and so infest the Seas, that Men of\\nCourage must starve:-- That if it was put to the Choice of the Pyrates,\\nthey would not have the punishment less than Death, the Fear of which, kept\\nsome dastardly Rogues honest; that many of those who are now cheating the\\nWidows and Orphans, and oppressing their poor Neighbours, who have no Money\\nto obtain Justice, would then rob at Sea, and the Ocean would be crowded\\nwith Rogues, like the Land, and no Merchant would venture out; so that the\\nTrade, in a little Time, would not be worth following.\\n\\nBeing found quick with Child, as has been observed, her Execution was\\nrespited, and it is possible she would have found Favour, but she was\\nseiz'd with a violent Fever, soon after her Tryal, of which she died in\\nPrison.\\n\\n_The_ LIFE _of_ ANNE BONNY.\\n\\nAS we have been more particular in the Lives of these two Women, than\\nthose of other Pyrates, it is incumbent on us, as a faithful Historian, to\\nbegin with their Birth. _Anne Bonny_ was born at a Town near _Cork_, in the\\nKingdom of _Ireland_, her Father an Attorney at Law, but _Anne_ was not one\\nof his legitimate Issue, which seems to cross an old Proverb, which says,\\n_that Bastards have the best Luck_. Her Father was a Married Man, and his\\nWife having been brought to Bed, contracted an Illness in her lying in, and\\nin order to recover her Health, she was advised to remove for Change of\\nAir; the Place she chose, was a few Miles distance from her Dwelling, where\\nher Husband's Mother liv'd. Here she sojourn'd some Time, her Husband\\nstaying at Home, to follow his Affairs. The Servant-Maid, whom she left to\\nlook after the House, and attend the Family, being a handsome young Woman,\\nwas courted by a young Man of the same Town, who was a _Tanner_; this\\n_Tanner_ used to take his Opportunities, when the Family was out of the\\nWay, of coming to pursue his Courtship; and being with the Maid one Day as\\nshe was employ'd in the Houshold Business, not having the Fear of God\\nbefore his Eyes, he takes his Opportunity, when her Back was turned, of\\nwhipping three Silver Spoons into his Pocket. The Maid soon miss'd the\\nSpoons, and knowing that no Body had been in the Room, but herself and the\\nyoung Man, since she saw them last, she charged him with taking them; he\\nvery stifly denied it, upon which she grew outragious, and threatned to go\\nto a Constable, in order to carry him before a Justice of Peace: These\\nMenaces frighten'd him out of his Wits, well knowing he could not stand\\nSearch; wherefore he endeavoured to pacify her, by desiring her to examine\\nthe Drawers and other Places, and perhaps she might find them; in this Time\\nhe slips into another Room, where the Maid usually lay, and puts the Spoons\\nbetwixt the Sheets, and then makes his Escape by a back Door, concluding\\nshe must find them, when she went to Bed, and so next Day he might pretend\\nhe did it only to frighten her, and the Thing might be laugh'd off for a\\nJest.\\n\\nAs soon as she miss'd him, she gave over her Search, concluding he had\\ncarried them off, and went directly to the Constable, in order to have him\\napprehended: The young Man was informed, that a Constable had been in\\nSearch of him, but he regarded it but little, not doubting but all would be\\nwell next Day. Three or four Days passed, and still he was told, the\\nConstable was upon the Hunt for him, this made him lye concealed, he could\\nnot comprehend the Meaning of it, he imagined no less, than that the Maid\\nhad a Mind to convert the Spoons to her own Use, and put the Robbery upon\\nhim.\\n\\nIt happened, at this Time, that the Mistress being perfectly recovered of\\nher late Indisposition, was return'd Home, in Company with her\\nMother-in-Law; the first News she heard, was of the Loss of the Spoons,\\nwith the Manner how; the Maid telling her, at the same Time, that the young\\nMan was run away. The young Fellow had Intelligence of the Mistress's\\nArrival, and considering with himself, that he could never appear again in\\nhis Business, unless this Matter was got over, and she being a good natured\\nWoman, he took a Resolution of going directly to her, and of telling her\\nthe whole Story, only with this Difference, that he did it for a Jest.\\n\\nThe Mistress could scarce believe it, however, she went directly to the\\nMaid's Room, and turning down the Bed Cloaths, there, to her great\\nSurprize, found the three Spoons; upon this she desired the young Man to go\\nHome and mind his Business, for he should have no Trouble about it.\\n\\nThe Mistress could not imagine the Meaning of this, she never had found the\\nMaid guilty of any pilfering, and therefore it could not enter her Head,\\nthat she designed to steal the Spoons her self; upon the whole, she\\nconcluded the Maid had not been in her Bed, from the Time the Spoons were\\nmiss'd, she grew immediately jealous upon it, and suspected, that the Maid\\nsupplied her Place with her Husband, during her Absence, and this was the\\nReason why the Spoons were no sooner found.\\n\\nShe call'd to Mind several Actions of Kindness, her Husband had shewed the\\nMaid, Things that pass'd unheeded by, when they happened, but now she had\\ngot that Tormentor, Jealousy, in her Head, amounted to Proofs of their\\nIntimacy; another Circumstance which strengthen'd the whole, was, that tho'\\nher Husband knew she was to come Home that Day, and had had no\\nCommunication with her in four Months, which was before her last Lying in,\\nyet he took an Opportunity of going out of Town that Morning, upon some\\nslight Pretence: --All these Things put together, confirm'd her in her\\nJealousy.\\n\\nAs Women seldom forgive Injuries of this Kind, she thought of discharging\\nher Revenge upon the Maid: In order to this, she leaves the Spoons where\\nshe found them, and orders the Maid to put clean Sheets upon the Bed,\\ntelling her, she intended to lye there herself that Night, because her\\nMother in Law was to lye in her Bed, and that she (the Maid) must lye in\\nanother Part of the House; the Maid in making the Bed, was surprized with\\nthe Sight of the Spoons, but there were very good Reasons, why it was not\\nproper for her to tell where she found them, therefore she takes them up,\\nputs them in her Trunk, intending to leave them in some Place, where they\\nmight be found by chance.\\n\\nThe Mistress, that every Thing might look to be done without Design, lies\\nthat Night in the Maid's Bed, little dreaming of what an Adventure it would\\nproduce: After she had been a Bed some Time, thinking on what had pass'd,\\nfor Jealousy kept her awake, she heard some Body enter the Room; at first\\nshe apprehended it to be Thieves, and was so fright'ned, she had not\\nCourage enough to call out; but when she heard these Words, Mary, _are you\\nawake_? She knew it to be her Husband's Voice; then her Fright was over,\\nyet she made no Answer, least he should find her out, if she spoke,\\ntherefore she resolved to counterfeit Sleep, and take what followed.\\n\\nThe Husband came to Bed, and that Night play'd the vigorous Lover; but one\\nThing spoil'd the Diversion on the Wife's Side, which was, the Reflection\\nthat it was not design'd for her; however she was very passive, and bore it\\nlike a Christian. Early before Day, she stole out of Bed, leaving him\\nasleep, and went to her Mother in Law, telling her what had passed, not\\nforgetting how he had used her, as taking her for the Maid; the Husband\\nalso stole out, not thinking it convenient to be catch'd in that Room; in\\nthe mean Time, the Revenge of the Mistress was strongly against the Maid,\\nand without considering, that to her she ow'd the Diversion of the Night\\nbefore, and that one good _Turn_ should deserve another; she sent for a\\nConstable, and charged her with stealing the Spoons: The Maid's Trunk was\\nbroke open, and the Spoons found, upon which she was carried before a\\nJustice of Peace, and by him committed to Goal.\\n\\nThe Husband loiter'd about till twelve a Clock at Noon, then comes Home,\\npretended he was just come to Town; as soon as he heard what had passed, in\\nRelation to the Maid, he fell into a great Passion with his Wife; this set\\nthe Thing into a greater Flame, the Mother takes the Wife's Part against\\nher own Son, insomuch that the Quarrel increasing, the Mother and Wife took\\nHorse immediately, and went back to the Mother's House, and the Husband and\\nWife never bedded together after.\\n\\nThe Maid lay a long Time in the Prison, it being near half a Year to the\\nAssizes; but before it happened, it was discovered she was with Child; when\\nshe was arraign'd at the Bar, she was discharged for want of Evidence; the\\nWife's Conscience touch'd her, and as she did not believe the Maid Guilty\\nof any Theft, except that of Love, she did not appear against her; soon\\nafter her Acquittal, she was delivered of a Girl.\\n\\nBut what alarm'd the Husband most, was, that it was discovered the Wife was\\nwith Child also, he taking it for granted, he had had no Intimacy with her,\\nsince her last lying in, grew jealous of her, in his Turn, and made this a\\nHandle to justify himself, for his Usage of her, pretending now he had\\nsuspected her long, but that here was Proof; she was delivered of Twins, a\\nBoy and a Girl.\\n\\nThe Mother fell ill, sent to her Son to reconcile him to his Wife, but he\\nwould not hearken to it; therefore she made a Will, leaving all she had in\\nthe Hands of certain Trustees, for the Use of the Wife and two Children\\nlately born, and died a few Days after.\\n\\nThis was an ugly Turn upon him, his greatest Dependence being upon his\\nMother; however, his Wife was kinder to him than he deserved, for she made\\nhim a yearly Allowance out of what was left, tho' they continued to live\\nseparate: It lasted near five Years; at this Time having a great Affection\\nfor the Girl he had by his Maid, he had a Mind to take it Home, to live\\nwith him; but as all the Town knew it to be a Girl, the better to disguise\\nthe Matter from them, as well as from his Wife, he had it put into\\nBreeches, as a Boy, pretending it was a Relation's Child he was to breed up\\nto be his Clerk.\\n\\nThe Wife heard he had a little Boy at Home he was very fond of, but as she\\ndid not know any Relation of his that had such a Child, she employ'd a\\nFriend to enquire further into it; this Person by talking with the Child,\\nfound it to be a Girl, discovered that the Servant-Maid was its Mother, and\\nthat the Husband still kept up his Correspondence with her.\\n\\nUpon this Intelligence, the Wife being unwilling that her Children's Money\\nshould go towards the Maintenance of Bastards, stopped the Allowance: The\\nHusband enraged, in a kind of Revenge, takes the Maid home, and lives with\\nher publickly, to the great Scandal of his Neighbours; but he soon found\\nthe bad Effect of it, for by Degrees lost his Practice, so that he saw\\nplainly he could not live there, therefore he thought of removing, and\\nturning what Effects he had into ready Money; he goes to _Cork_, and there\\nwith his Maid and Daughter embarques for _Carolina_.\\n\\nAt first he followed the Practice of the Law in that Province, but\\nafterwards fell into Merchandize, which proved more successful to him, for\\nhe gained by it sufficient to purchase a considerable Plantation: His Maid,\\nwho passed for his Wife, happened to dye, after which his Daughter, our\\n_Anne Bonny_, now grown up, kept his House.\\n\\nShe was of a fierce and couragious Temper, wherefore, when she lay under\\nCondemnation, several Stories were reported of her, much to her\\nDisadvantage, as that she had kill'd an _English_ Servant-Maid once in her\\nPassion with a Case-Knife, while she look'd after her Father's House; but\\nupon further Enquiry, I found this Story to be groundless: It was certain\\nshe was so robust, that once, when a young Fellow would have lain with her,\\nagainst her Will, she beat him so, that he lay ill of it a considerable\\nTime.\\n\\nWhile she lived with her Father, she was look'd upon as one that would be a\\ngood Fortune, wherefore it was thought her Father expected a good Match for\\nher; but she spoilt all, for without his Consent, she marries a young\\nFellow, who belonged to the Sea, and was not worth a Groat; which provoked\\nher Father to such a Degree, that he turned her out of Doors, upon which\\nthe young Fellow, who married her, finding himself disappointed in his\\nExpectation, shipped himself and Wife, for the Island of _Providence_,\\nexpecting Employment there.\\n\\nHere she became acquainted with _Rackam_ the Pyrate, who making Courtship\\nto her, soon found Means of withdrawing her Affections from her Husband, so\\nthat she consented to elope from him, and go to Sea with _Rackam_ in Men's\\nCloaths: She was as good as her Word, and after she had been at Sea some\\nTime, she proved with Child, and beginning to grow big, _Rackam_ landed her\\non the Island of _Cuba_; and recommending her there to some Friends of his,\\nthey took Care of her, till she was brought to Bed: When she was up and\\nwell again, he sent for her to bear him Company.\\n\\nThe King's Proclamation being out, for pardoning of Pyrates, he took the\\nBenefit of it, and surrendered; afterwards being sent upon the privateering\\nAccount, he returned to his old Trade, as has been already hinted in the\\nStory of _Mary Read_. In all these Expeditions, _Anne Bonny_ bore him\\nCompany, and when any Business was to be done in their Way, no Body was\\nmore forward or couragious than she, and particularly when they were taken;\\nshe and _Mary Read_, with one more, were all the Persons that durst keep\\nthe Deck, as has been before hinted.\\n\\nHer Father was known to a great many Gentlemen, Planters of _Jamaica_, who\\nhad dealt with him, and among whom he had a good Reputation; and some of\\nthem, who had been in _Carolina_, remember'd to have seen her in his House;\\nwherefore they were inclined to shew her Favour, but the Action of leaving\\nher Husband was an ugly Circumstance against her. The Day that _Rackam_ was\\nexecuted, by special Favour, he was admitted to see her; but all the\\nComfort she gave him, was, _that she was sorry to see him there, but if he\\nhad fought like a Man, he need not have been hang'd like a Dog_.\\n\\nShe was continued in Prison, to the Time of her lying in, and afterwards\\nreprieved from Time to Time; but what is become of her since, we cannot\\ntell; only this we know, that she was not executed.\\n\\nCHAP. VIII. OF Captain _Howel Davis_, And his CREW.\\n\\nCAptain _Howel Davis_ was born at _Milford_, in _Monmouthshire_, and\\nwas from a Boy brought up to the Sea. The last Voyage he made from\\n_England_, was in the _Cadogan_ Snow of _Bristol_, Captain _Skinner_\\nCommander, bound for the Coast of _Guiney_, of which Snow _Davis_ was chief\\nMate: They were no sooner arrived at _Sierraleon_ on the aforesaid Coast,\\nbut they were taken by the Pyrate _England_, who plunder'd them, and\\n_Skinner_ was barbarously murdered, as has been related before in the Story\\nof Captain _England_.\\n\\nAfter the Death of Captain _Skinner, Davis_ pretended that he was mightily\\nsollicited by _England_ to engage with him; but that he resolutely\\nanswered, he would sooner be shot to Death than sign the Pyrates Articles.\\nUpon which, _England_, pleased with his Bravery, sent him and the rest of\\nthe Men again on Board the Snow, appointing him Captain of her, in the Room\\nof _Skinner_, commanding him to pursue his Voyage. He also gave him a\\nwritten Paper sealed up, with Orders to open it when he should come into a\\ncertain Latitude, and at the Peril of his Life follow the Orders therein\\nset down. This was an Air of Grandeur like what Princes practice to their\\nAdmirals and Generals.--It was punctually complied with by _Davis_, who\\nread it to the Ship's Company; it contained no less than a generous Deed of\\nGift of the Ship and Cargoe, to _Davis_ and the Crew, ordering him to go to\\n_Brasil_ and dispose of the Lading to the best Advantage, and to make a\\nfair and equal Dividend with the rest.\\n\\n_Davis_ proposed to the Crew, whether they were willing to follow their\\nDirections, but to his great Surprize, found the Majority of them\\naltogether averse to it, wherefore in a Rage, he bad them be damn'd, and go\\nwhere they would. They knew that Part of their Cargoe was consigned to\\ncertain Merchants at _Barbadoes_, wherefore they steered for that Island.\\nWhen they arrived, they related to these Merchants the unfortunate Death of\\n_Skinner_, and the Proposal which had been made to them by _Davis_; upon\\nwhich _Davis_ was seized and committed to Prison, where he was kept three\\nMonths; however, as he had been in no Act of Pyracy, he was discharged\\nwithout being brought to any Tryal, yet he could not expect any Employment\\nthere; wherefore knowing that the Island of _Providence_ was a kind of\\nRendevouz of Pyrates, he was resolved to make one amongst them, if\\npossible, and to that Purpose, found Means of shipping himself for that\\nIsland; but he was again disappointed, for when he arrived there, the\\nPyrates had newly surrendered to Captain _Woods Rogers_, and accepted of\\nthe Act of Grace, which he had just brought from _England_.\\n\\nHowever, _Davis_ was not long out of Business, for Captain _Rogers_ having\\nfitted out two Sloops for Trade, one called the _Buck_, the other the\\n_Mumvil Trader; Davis_ found an Employment on Board of one of them; the\\nLading of these Sloops was of considerable Value, consisting of _European_\\nGoods, in order to be exchanged with the _French_ and _Spaniards_; and many\\nof the Hands on Board of them, were the Pyrates lately come in upon the\\nlate Act of Grace. The first Place they touched at, was the Island of\\n_Martinico_, belonging to the _French_, where _Davis_ having conspired with\\nsome others, rise in the Night, secured the Master and seized the Sloop; as\\nsoon as this was done, they called to the other Sloop, which lay a little\\nWay from them, among whom they knew there were a great many Hands ripe for\\nRebellion, and ordered them to come on Board of them; they did so, and the\\ngreatest Part of them agreed to join with _Davis_; those who were otherwise\\ninclined, were sent back on Board the _Mumvil_ Sloop, to go where they\\npleased, _Davis_ having first taken out of her, every Thing which he\\nthought might be of Use.\\n\\nAfter this, a Counsel of War was called over a large Bowl of Punch, at\\nwhich it was proposed to chuse a Commander; the Election was soon over, for\\nit fell upon _Davis_ by a great Majority of _legal Pollers_, there was no\\nScrutiny demanded, for all acquiesced in the Choice: As soon as he was\\npossess'd of his Command, he drew up Articles, which were signed and sworn\\nto by himself and the rest, then he made a short Speech, the sum of which,\\nwas, a Declaration of War against the whole World.\\n\\nAfter this they consulted about a proper Place where they might clean their\\nSloop, a light Pair of Heels being of great Use either to take, or escape\\nbeing taken; for this purpose they made Choice of _Coxon_'s _Hole_, at the\\nEast End of the Island of _Cuba_, a Place where they might secure\\nthemselves from Surprize, the Entrance being so narrow, that one Ship might\\nkeep out a hundred.\\n\\nHere they cleaned with much Difficulty, for they had no Carpenter in their\\nCompany, a Person of great Use upon such Exigencies; from hence they put to\\nSea, making to the North-Side of the Island of _Hispaniola_. The first Sail\\nwhich fell in their Way, was a _French_ Ship of twelve Guns; it must be\\nobserved, that _Davis_ had but thirty five Hands, yet Provisions began to\\ngrow short with him; wherefore he attacked this Ship, she soon struck, and\\nhe sent twelve of his Hands on Board of her, in order to plunder: This was\\nno sooner done, but a Sail was spied a great Way to Windward of them; they\\nenquired of the _French_ Man what she might be, he answered, that he had\\nspoke with a Ship, the Day before, of 24 Guns and 60 Men, and he took this\\nto be the same.\\n\\n_Davis_ then proposed to his Men to attack her, telling them, she would be\\na rare Ship for their Use, but they looked upon it to be an extravagant\\nAttempt, and discovered no Fondness for it, but he assured them he had a\\nStratagem in his Head would make all safe; wherefore he gave Chace, and\\nordered his Prize to do the same. The Prize being a slow Sailor, _Davis_\\nfirst came up with the Enemy, and standing along Side of them, shewed his\\npyratical Colours: They, much surpriz'd, called to _Davis_, telling him,\\nthey wondered at his Impudence in venturing to come so near them, and\\nordered him to strike; but he answered, that he intended to keep them in\\nPlay, till his Consort came up, who was able to deal with them, and that if\\nthey did not strike to him, they should have but bad Quarters; whereupon he\\ngave them a Broad-Side, which they returned.\\n\\nIn the mean Time the Prize drew near, who obliged all the Prisoners to come\\nupon Deck in white Shirts, to make a Shew of Force, as they had been\\ndirected by _Davis_; they also hoisted a dirty Tarpawlin, by Way of black\\nFlag, they having no other, and fir'd a Gun: The _French_ Men were so\\nintimidated by this Appearance of Force, that they struck. _Davis_ called\\nout to the Captain to come on Board of him, with twenty of his Hands; he\\ndid so, and they were all for the greater Security clapt into Irons, the\\nCaptain excepted: Then he sent four of his own Men on Board the first\\nPrize, and in order still to carry on the Cheat, spoke aloud, that they\\nshould give his Service to the Captain, and desire him to send some Hands\\non Board the Prize, to see what they had got; but at the same Time gave\\nthem a written Paper, with Instructions what to do. Here he ordered them to\\nnail up the Guns in the little Prize, to take out all the small Arms and\\nPowder, and to go every Man of them on Board the second Prize; when this\\nwas done, he ordered that more of the Prisoners should be removed out of\\nthe great Prize, into the little one, by which he secured himself from any\\nAttempt which might be feared from their Numbers; for those on Board of him\\nwere fast in Irons, and those in the little Prize had neither Arms nor\\nAmmunition.\\n\\nThus the three Ships kept Company for 2 Days, when finding the great Prize\\nto be a very dull Sailor, he thought she would not be fit for his Purpose,\\nwherefore he resolved to restore her to the Captain, with all his Hands;\\nbut first, he took Care to take out all her Ammunition, and every Thing\\nelse which he might possibly want. The _French_ Captain was in such a Rage,\\nat being so outwitted, that when he got on Board his own Ship, he was going\\nto throw himself over-board, but was prevented by his Men.\\n\\nHaving let go both his Prizes, he steered Northward, in which Course he\\ntook a small _Spanish_ Sloop; after this, he made towards the _Western_\\nIslands, but met with no Booty thereabouts; then he steered for the _Cape\\nde Verde_ Islands, they cast Anchor at St. _Nicholas_, hoisting _English_\\nColours; the _Portuguese_ inhabiting there, took him for an _English_\\nPrivateer, and _Davis_ going ashore, they both treated him very civilly,\\nand also traded with him. Here he remained five Weeks, in which Time, he\\nand half his Crew, for their Pleasure, took a Journey to the chief Town of\\nthe Island, which was 19 Miles up the Country: _Davis_ making a good\\nAppearance, was caressed by the Governor and the Inhabitants, and no\\nDiversion was wanting which the _Portuguese_ could shew, or Money could\\npurchase; after about a Week's Stay, he came back to the Ship, and the rest\\nof the Crew went to take their Pleasure up to the Town, in their Turn.\\n\\nAt their Return they clean'd their Ship, and put to Sea, but not with their\\nwhole Company; for five of them, like _Hannibal_'s Men, were so charm'd\\nwith the Luxuries of the Place, and the free Conversation of some Women,\\nthat they staid behind; and one of them, whose Name was _Charles Franklin_,\\na _Monmouthshire_ Man, married and settled himself, and lives there to this\\nDay.\\n\\nFrom hence they sailed to _Bonevista_, and looked into that Harbour, but\\nfinding nothing, they steer'd for the Isle of _May_: When they arrived\\nhere, they met with a great many Ships and Vessels in the Road, all which\\nthey plundered, taking out of them whatever they wanted; and also\\nstrengthen'd themselves with a great many fresh Hands, who most of them\\nenter'd voluntarily. One of the Ships they took to their own Use, mounted\\nher with twenty six Guns, and call'd her the _King James_. There being no\\nfresh Water hereabouts, they made towards St. _Jago_, belonging to the\\n_Portuguese_, in order to lay in a Store; _Davis_, with a few Hands, going\\nashore to find the most commodious Place to water at, the Governor, with\\nsome Attendants, came himself and examined who they were, and whence they\\ncame? And not liking _Davis_'s Account of himself, the Governor was so\\nplain to tell them, he suspected them to be Pyrates. _Davis_ seemed\\nmightily affronted, standing much upon his Honour, replying to the\\nGovernor, he scorn'd his Words; however, as soon as his Back was turn'd,\\nfor fear of Accidents, he got on Board again as fast as he could. _Davis_\\nrelated what had happened, and his Men seemed to resent the Affront which\\nhad been offered him. _Davis_, upon this, told them, he was confident he\\ncould surprize the Fort in the Night; they agreed with him to attempt it,\\nand accordingly, when it grew late, they went ashore well arm'd; and the\\nGuard which was kept, was so negligent, that they got within the Fort\\nbefore any Alarm was given: When it was too late there was some little\\nResistance made, and three Men killed on _Davis_'s Side. Those in the Fort,\\nin their Hurry, run into the Governor's House to save themselves, which\\nthey barricadoed so strongly, that _Davis_'s Party could not enter it;\\nhowever, they threw in Granadoe-Shells, which not only ruin'd all the\\nFurniture, but kill'd several Men within.\\n\\nWhen it was Day the whole Country was alarm'd, and came to attack the\\nPyrates; wherefore it not being their Business to stand a Siege, they made\\nthe best of their Way on Board their Ship again, after having dismounted\\nthe Guns of the Fort. By this Enterprize they did a great Deal of Mischief\\nto the _Portuguese_, and but very little Good to themselves.\\n\\nHaving put to Sea they muster'd their Hands, and found themselves near\\nseventy strong; then it was proposed what Course they should steer, and\\ndiffering in their Opinions, they divided, and by a Majority it was carried\\nfor _Gambia_ on the Coast of _Guiney_; of this Opinion was _Davis_, he\\nhaving been employ'd in that Trade, was acquainted with the Coast: He told\\nthem, that there was a great deal of Money always kept in _Gambia_ Castle,\\nand that it would be worth their while to make an Attempt upon it. They\\nask'd him how it was possible, since it was garrisoned? He desired they\\nwould leave the Management of it to him, and he would undertake to make\\nthem Masters of it. They began now to conceive so high an Opinion of his\\nConduct, as well as Courage, that they thought nothing impossible to him,\\ntherefore they agreed to obey him, without enquiring further into his\\nDesign.\\n\\nHaving come within Sight of the Place, he ordered all his Men under Deck,\\nexcept as many as were absolutely necessary for working the Ship, that\\nthose from the Fort seeing a Ship with so few Hands, might have no\\nSuspicion of her being any other than a trading Vessel; then he ran close\\nunder the Fort, and there cast Anchor; and having ordered out the Boat, he\\ncommanded six Men in her, in old ordinary Jackets, while he himself, with\\nthe Master and Doctor, dressed themselves like Gentlemen; his Design being,\\nthat the Men should look like common Sailors, and they like Merchants. In\\nrowing ashore he gave his Men Instructions what to say in Case any\\nQuestions should be asked them.\\n\\nBeing come to the landing Place, he was received by a File of Musqueteers,\\nand conducted into the Fort, where the Governor accosting them civilly,\\nask'd them who they were, and whence they came? They answered they were of\\n_Liverpool_, bound for the River of _Sinnegal_, to trade for Gum and\\nElephants Teeth, but that they were chaced on that Coast by two _French_\\nMen of War, and narrowly escaped being taken, having a little the Heels of\\nthem; but now they were resolved to make the best of a bad Market, and\\nwould Trade here for Slaves; then the Governor ask'd them, what was the\\nchief of their Cargo? They answered, Iron and Plate, which were good Things\\nthere; the Governor told them he would Slave them to the full Value of\\ntheir Cargoe, and asked them, if they had any _European_ Liquor on Board?\\nthey answered, a little for their own Use; however, a Hamper should be at\\nhis Service. The Governor then very civilly invited them all to stay and\\ndine with him; _Davis_ told him, that being Commander of the Ship, he must\\ngo on Board to see her well moored, and give some other Orders, but those\\ntwo Gentlemen might stay, and that he himself would also return before\\nDinner, and bring the Hamper of Liquor with him.\\n\\nWhile he was in the Fort, his Eyes were very busy in observing how Things\\nlay; he took Notice there was a Centry at the Entrance, and a Guard-House\\njust by it, where the Soldiers upon Duty commonly waited, their Arms\\nstanding in a Corner, in a Heap; he saw also a great many small Arms in the\\nGovernor's Hall; now when he came on Board, he assured his Men of Success,\\ndesiring them not to get drunk, and that as soon as they saw the Flag upon\\nthe Castle struck, they might conclude he was Master, and send twenty Hands\\nimmediately ashore; in the mean Time, there being a Sloop at Anchor near\\nthem, he sent some Hands in a Boat, to secure the Master and all the Men,\\nand bring them on Board of him, least they observing any Bustle or arming\\nin his Ship, might send ashore and give Intelligence.\\n\\nThese Precautions being taken, he ordered his Men, who were to go in the\\nBoat with him, to put two Pair of Pistols each under their Cloaths, he\\ndoing the like himself, and gave them Directions to go into the Guard-Room,\\nand to enter into Conversation with the Soldiers, and observe when he\\nshould fire a Pistol thro' the Governor's Window, to start up at once and\\nsecure the Arms in the Guard-Room.\\n\\nWhen _Davis_ arrived, Dinner not being ready, the Governor proposed that\\nthey should pass their Time in making a Bowl of Punch till Dinner-Time: It\\nmust be observed, that _Davis_'s Coxen waited upon them, who had an\\nOpportunity of going about all Parts of the House, to see what Strength\\nthey had, he whispered _Davis_, there being no Person then in the Room, but\\nhe, _(Davis)_ the Master, the Doctor, the Coxen and Governor; _Davis_ on a\\nsudden drew out a Pistol, clapt it to the Governor's Breast, telling him,\\nhe must surrender the Fort and all the Riches in it, or he was a dead Man.\\nThe Governor being no Ways prepared for such an Attack, promised to be very\\nPassive, and do all they desired, therefore they shut the Door, took down\\nall the Arms that hung in the Hall, and loaded them. _Davis_ fires his\\nPistol thro' the Window, upon which his Men, without, executed their Part\\nof the Scheme, like Heroes, in an Instant; getting betwixt the Soldiers and\\ntheir Arms, all with their Pistols cock'd in their Hands, while one of them\\ncarried the Arms out. When this was done, they locked the Soldiers into the\\nGuard-Room, and kept Guard without.\\n\\nIn the mean Time one of them struck the Union Flag on the Top of the\\nCastle, at which Signal those on Board sent on Shore a Reinforcement of\\nHands, and they got Possession of the Fort without the least Hurry or\\nConfusion, or so much as a Man lost of either Side.\\n\\n_Davis_ harangued the Soldiers, upon which a great many of them took on\\nwith him, those who refused, he sent on Board the little Sloop, and because\\nhe would not be at the Trouble of a Guard for them, he ordered all the\\nSails and Cables out of her, which might hinder them from attempting to get\\naway.\\n\\nThis Day was spent in a kind of Rejoycing, the Castle firing her Guns to\\nsalute the Ship, and the Ship the Castle; but the next Day they minded\\ntheir Business, that is, they fell to plundering, but they found Things\\nfall vastly short of their Expectation; for they discovered, that a great\\ndeal of Money had been lately sent away; however, they met with the Value\\nof about two thousand Pounds Sterling in Bar Gold, and a great many other\\nrich Effects: Every Thing they liked, which was portable, they brought\\naboard their Ship; some Things which they had no Use for, they were so\\ngenerous to make a Present of, to the Master and Crew of the little Sloop,\\nto whom they also returned his Vessel again, and then they fell to work in\\ndismounting the Guns, and demolishing the Fortifications.\\n\\nAfter they had done as much Mischief as they could, and were weighing\\nAnchor to be gone, they spy'd a Ship bearing down upon them in full Sail;\\nthey soon got their Anchor's up, and were in a Readiness to receive her.\\nThis Ship prov'd to be a _French_ Pyrate of fourteen Guns and sixty four\\nHands, half _French_, half Negroes; the Captain's Name was _La Bouse_; he\\nexpected no less than a rich Prize, which made him so eager in the Chace;\\nbut when he came near enough to see their Guns, and the Number of their\\nHands upon Deck, he began to think he should catch a _Tartar_, and supposed\\nher to be a small _English_ Man of War; however, since there was no\\nescaping, he resolved to do a bold and desperate Action, which was to board\\n_Davis_. As he was making towards her, for this Purpose, he fired a Gun,\\nand hoisted his black Colours; _Davis_ returned the Salute, and hoisted his\\nblack Colours also. The _French_ Man was not a little pleased at this happy\\nMistake; they both hoisted out their Boats, and the Captains went to meet\\nand congratulate one another with a Flag of Truce in their Sterns; a great\\nmany Civilities passed between them, and _La Bouse_ desired _Davis_, that\\nthey might sail down the Coast together, that he _(La Bouse)_ might get a\\nbetter Ship: _Davis_ agreed to it, and very courteously promised him the\\nfirst Ship he took, fit for his Use, he would give him, as being willing to\\nencourage a willing Brother.\\n\\nThe first Place they touch'd at, was _Sierraleon_, where at first going in,\\nthey spied a tall Ship at Anchor; _Davis_ being the best Sailor first came\\nup with her, and wondering that she did not try to make off, suspected her\\nto be a Ship of Force. As soon as he came along Side of her, she brought a\\nSpring upon her Cable, and fired a whole Broadside upon _Davis_, at the\\nsame Time hoisted a black Flag; _Davis_ hoisted his black Flag in like\\nManner, and fired one Gun to Leeward.\\n\\nIn fine, she proved to be a Pyrate Ship of twenty four Guns, commanded by\\none _Cocklyn_, who expecting these two would prove Prizes, let them come\\nin, least his getting under Sail might frighten them away.\\n\\nThis Satisfaction was great on all Sides, at this Junction of Confederates\\nand Brethren in Iniquity; two Days they spent in improving their\\nAcquaintance and Friendship, the third Day _Davis_ and _Cocklyn_, agreed to\\ngo in _La Bouse_'s Brigantine and attack the Fort; they contrived it so, as\\nto get up thither by high Water; those in the Fort suspected them to be\\nwhat they really were, and therefore stood upon their Defence; when the\\nBrigantine came within Musket-Shot, the Fort fired all their Guns upon her,\\nthe Brigantine did the like upon the Fort, and so held each other in Play\\nfor several Hours, when the two confederate Ships were come up to the\\nAssistance of the Brigantine; those who defended the Fort, seeing such a\\nNumber of Hands on Board these Ships, had not the Courage to stand it any\\nlonger, but abandoning the Fort, left it to the Mercy of the Pyrates.\\n\\nThey took Possession of it, and continued there near seven Weeks, in which\\nTime they all cleaned their Ships. We should have observed, that a Galley\\ncame into the Road while they were there, which _Davis_ insisted should be\\nyielded to _La Bouse_, according to his Word of Honour before given;\\n_Cocklyn_ did not oppose it, so _La Bouse_ went into her, with his Crew,\\nand cutting away her half Deck, mounted her with twenty four Guns.\\n\\nHaving called a Counsel of War, they agreed to sail down the Coast\\ntogether, and for the greater Grandeur, appointed a Commadore, which was\\n_Davis_; but they had not kept Company long, when drinking together on\\nBoard of _Davis_, they had like to have fallen together by the Ears, the\\nstrong Liquor stirring up a Spirit of Discord among them, and they\\nquarrelled, but _Davis_ put an End to it, by this short Speech:--_Heark ye,\\nyou_ Cocklin _and_ La Bouse, _I find by strengthening you, I have put a Rod\\ninto your Hands to whip my self, but I'm still able to deal with you both;\\nbut since we met in Love, let us part in Love, for I find, that three of a\\nTrade can never agree_.--Upon which the other two went on Board their\\nrespective Ships, and immediately parted, each steering a different Course.\\n\\n_Davis_ held on his Way down the Coast, and making Cape _Appollonia_, he\\nmet with two _Scotch_ and one _English_ Vessel, which he plundered, and\\nthen let go. About five Days after he fell in with a _Dutch_ Interloper of\\nthirty Guns and ninety Men, (half being _English_,) off Cape _Three Points_\\nBay; _Davis_ coming up along Side of her, the _Dutch_ Man gave the first\\nFire, and pouring in a broad-Side upon _Davis_, killed nine of his Men,\\n_Davis_ returned it, and a very hot Engagement followed, which lasted from\\none a Clock at Noon, till nine next Morning, when the _Dutch_ Man struck,\\nand yielded her self their Prize.\\n\\n_Davis_ fitted up the _Dutch_ Ship for his own Use, and called her the\\n_Rover_, aboard of which he mounted thirty two Guns, and twenty seven\\nSwivels, and proceeded with her and the _King James_, to _Anamaboe_; he\\nentered the Bay betwixt the Hours of twelve and one at Noon, and found\\nthere three Ships lying at Anchor, who were trading for Negroes, Gold and\\nTeeth: The Names of these Ships were the _Hink_ Pink, Captain _Hall_\\nCommander, the _Princess_, Captain _Plumb_, of which _Roberts_, who will\\nmake a considerable Figure in the sequel of this History, was second Mate,\\nand the _Morrice_ Sloop, Captain _Fin_; he takes these Ships without any\\nResistance, and having plundered them, he makes a Present of one of them,\\n_viz._ the _Morrice_ Sloop, to the _Dutch_ Men, on Board of which alone\\nwere found a hundred and forty Negroes, besides dry Goods, and a\\nconsiderable Quantity of Gold-Dust.\\n\\nIt happened there were several Canoes along Side of this last, when _Davis_\\ncame in, who saved themselves and got ashore; these gave Notice at the\\nFort, that these Ships were Pyrates, upon which the Fort fired upon them,\\nbut without any Execution, for their Mettle was not of Weight enough to\\nreach them; _Davis_ therefore, by Way of Defiance, hoisted his black Flag\\nand returned their Compliment.\\n\\nThe same Day he sail'd with his three Ships, making his Way down the Coast\\ntowards _Princes_, a _Portuguese_ Colony: But, before we proceed any\\nfarther in _Davis_'s Story, we shall give our Reader an Account of the\\n_Portuguese_ Settlements on this Coast, with other curious Remarks, as they\\nwere communicated to me by an ingenious Gentleman, lately arrived from\\nthose Parts.\\n\\n_A Description of the Islands of_ St. THOME, DEL PRINCIPE, _and_\\nANNOBONO.\\n\\nAS the _Portuguese_ were the great Improvers of Navigation, and the\\nfirst _Europeans_ who traded too and settled on the Coasts of _Africa_,\\neven round to _India_, and made those Discoveries, which now turn so much\\nto the Advantage of other Nations, it may not be amiss, previously to a\\nDescription of those Islands, to hint on that wonderful Property of the\\nLoadstone, that a little before had been found out, and enabled them to\\npursue such new and daring Navigations.\\n\\nThe attractive Power of the Loadstone, was universally known with the\\nAncients, as may be believed by its being a native Fossil of the\\n_Grecians_, (_Magnes a Magnesia_) but its directive, or polar Virtue, has\\nonly been known to us within this 350 Years, and said to be found out by\\n_John Goia_ of _Malphi_, in the Kingdom of _Naples, Prima dedit nautis usum\\nmagnetis Amalphi_; tho' others think, and assure us, it was transported by\\n_Paulus Venetus_ from _China_ to _Italy_, like the other famous Arts of\\nmodern Use with us, PRINTING and _the Use of_ GUNS.\\n\\nThe other Properties of Improvements of the Magnet, _viz._ Variation, or\\nits Defluction from an exact N. or S. Line, Variation of that Variation,\\nand its Inclination, were the Inventions of _Sebastian Cabot_, Mr.\\n_Gellibrand_, and Mr. _Norman_; the Inclination of the Needle, or that\\nProperty whereby it keeps an Elevation above the Horizon, in all Places but\\nunder the Equator, (where its Parallel) is as surprizing a Phænomenon as\\nany, and was the Discovery of our Countrymen; and could it be found\\nregular, I imagine would very much help towards the Discovery of Longitude,\\nat least would point out better Methods than hitherto known, when Ships\\ndrew nigh Land, which would answer as useful an End.\\n\\nBefore the Verticity and Use of the Compass, the _Portuguese_ Navigations\\nhad extended no farther than Cape _Non_, (it was their _ne plus ultra_,)\\nand therefore so called; distress of Weather, indeed, had drove some\\nCoasters to _Porto Santo_, and _Madera_, before any certain Method of\\nsteering was invented; but after the Needle was seen thus inspired,\\nNavigation every Year improved under the great Incouragements of _Henry,\\nAlphonsus_, and _John_ II. Kings of _Portugal_, in Part of the 14th and in\\nthe 15th Century.\\n\\nKing _Alphonsus_ was not so much at leasure as his Predecessor, to pursue\\nthese Discoveries, but having seen the Advantages accrued to _Portugal_ by\\nthem, and that the Pope had confirmed the perpetual Donation of all they\\nshould discover between Cape _Bajadore_ and _India_, inclusively, he\\nresolved not to neglect the proper Assistance, and farmed the Profits that\\ndid or might ensue to one _Bernard Gomez_, a Citizen of _Lisbon_, who was\\nevery Voyage obliged to discover 100 Leagues, still farther on: And about\\nthe Year 1470 made these Islands, the only Places (of all the considerable\\nand large Colonies they had in _Africa_,) that do now remain to that Crown.\\n\\nSt. _Thome_ is the principal of the three, whose Governour is stiled\\nCaptain General of the Islands, and from whom the other at _Princes_\\nreceives his Commission, tho' nominated by the Court of _Portugal_: It is a\\nBishoprick with a great many secular Clergy who appear to have neither\\nLearning nor Devotion, as may be judged by several of them being Negroes:\\nOne of the Chief of them, invited us to hear Mass, as a Diversion to pass\\nTime away, where he, and his inferior Brethren acted such affected Gestures\\nand Strains of Voice, as shewed to their Dishonour, they had no other Aim\\nthan pleasing us; and what I think was still worse, it was not without a\\nView of Interest; for as these Clergy are the chief Traders, they stoop to\\npitiful and scandalous Methods for ingratiating themselves: They and the\\nGovernment, on this trading Account, maintain as great Harmony, being ever\\njealous of each other, and practising little deceitful Arts to monopolize\\nwhat Strangers have to offer for sale, whether Toys or Cloaths, which of\\nall Sorts are ever Commodious with the _Portuguese_, in all Parts of the\\nWorld; an ordinary Suit of Black will sell for seven or eight Pound; a\\nTurnstile Wig of four Shillings, for a Moidore; a Watch of forty Shillings,\\nfor six Pound, _&c_.\\n\\nThe Town is of mean Building, but large and populous, the Residence of the\\ngreater Part of the Natives, who, thro' the whole Island, are computed at\\n10000, the Militia at 3000, and are in general, a rascally thievish\\nGeneration, as an old grave Friend of mine can Witness; for he having\\ncarried a Bag of second hand Cloaths on Shore, to truck for Provisions,\\nseated himself on the Sand for that Purpose, presently gathered a Crowd\\nround him, to view them; one of which desired to know the Price of a black\\nSuit, that unluckily lay uppermost, and was the best of them, agreeing to\\nthe Demand, with little Hesitation, provided it would but fit him; he put\\nthem on immediately, in as much hurry as possible, without any _co-licentia\\nSeignor_; and when my Friend was about to commend the Goodness of the Suit,\\nand Exactness they set with, not dreaming of the Impudence of running away\\nfrom a Crowd, the Rascal took to his Heels, my Friend followed and bawled\\nvery much, and tho' there was 500 People about the Place, it served to no\\nother End but making him a clear Stage, that the best Pair of Heels might\\ncarry it; so he lost the Suit of Cloaths, and before he could return to his\\nBag, others of them had beat off his Servant, and shared the rest.\\n\\nMost of the Ships from _Guiney_, of their own Nation, and frequently those\\nof ours, call at one or other of these Islands, to recruit with fresh\\nProvisions, and take in Water, which on the Coast are not so good, nor so\\nconveniently to come by: Their own Ships likewise, when they touch here,\\nare obliged to leave the King his Custom for their Slaves, which is always\\nin Gold, at so much a Head, without any Deduction at _Brasil_, for the\\nMortality that may happen afterwards; this by being a constant Bank to pay\\noff the civil and military Charges of the Government, prevents the\\nInconveniency of Remittances, and keeps both it and _Princes_ Isle rich\\nenough to pay ready Money for every Thing they want of _Europeans_.\\n\\nTheir Beefs are small and lean, (two hundred Weight or a little more,) but\\nthe Goats, Hogs and Fowls very good, their Sugar course and dirty, and Rum\\nvery ordinary; as these Refreshments lay most with People who are in want\\nof other Necessaries, they come to us in Way of bartering, very cheap: A\\ngood Hog for an old Cutlash; a fat Fowl for a Span of _Brasil_ Tobacco, (no\\nother Sort being valued, _&c_.) But with Money you give eight Dollars _per_\\nHead for Cattle; three Dollars for a Goat; six Dollars for a grown Hog; a\\nTestune and a Half for a Fowl; a Dollar _per_ Gallon for Rum; two Dollars a\\nRoove for Sugar; and half a Dollar for a Dozen of Paraquets: Here is Plenty\\nlikewise of Corn and Farine, of Limes, Citrons and Yamms.\\n\\nThe Island is reckoned nigh a Square, each Side 18 Leagues long, hilly, and\\nlays under the _Æquinoctial_, a wooden Bridge just without the Town, being\\nsaid not to deviate the least Part of a Minute, either to the Southward or\\nNorthward; and notwithstanding this warm Scituation, and continual vertical\\nSuns, the Islanders are very healthy, imputed by those who are disposed to\\nbe merry, in a great Measure to the Want of even so much as one Surgeon or\\nPhysician amongst them.\\n\\nIsle _Del Principe_, the next in Magnitude, a pleasant and delightful Spot\\nto the grave, and thoughtfull Disposition of the _Portuguese_, an\\nImprovement of Country Retirement, in that, this may be a happy and\\nuninterrupted Retreat from the whole World.\\n\\nI shall divide what I have to say on this Island, into Observations made on\\nour Approach to it, on the Seas round it, the Harbour, Produce of the\\nIsland and Seasons, Way of Living among the Inhabitants, some Custom of the\\nNegroes, with such proper Deductions on each as may illustrate the\\nDescription, and inform the Reader.\\n\\nWe were bound hither from _Whydah_, at the latter Part of the Month _July_,\\nwhen the Rains are over, and the Winds hang altogether S. W. (as they do\\nbefore the Rains, S. E.) yet with this Wind (when at Sea) we found the Ship\\ngained unexpectedly so far to the Southward, (_i. e._ Windward,) that we\\ncould with ease have weathered any of the Islands, and this seems next to\\nimpossible should be, if the Currents, which were strong to Leeward, in the\\nRoad of _Whydah_, had extended in like Manner cross the Bite of _Benin_:\\nNo, it must then have been very difficult to have weathered even Cape\\n_Formosa_: On this Occasion, I shall farther expatiate upon the Currents on\\nthe whole Coast of _Guiney_.\\n\\nThe Southern Coast of _Africa_ runs in a Line of Latitude, the Northern on\\nan Eastern Line, but both strait, with the fewest Inlets, Gulphs or Bays,\\nof either of the four Continents; the only large and remarkable one, is\\nthat of _Benin_ and _Calabar_, towards which the Currents of each Coast\\ntend, and is strongest from the Southward, because more open to a larger\\nSea, whose rising it is (tho' little and indiscernable at any Distance from\\nthe Land,) that gives rise to these Currents close in Shore, which are\\nnothing but Tides altered and disturbed by the Make and Shape of Lands.\\n\\nFor Proof of this, I shall lay down the following Observations as certain\\nFacts. That in the Rivers of _Gambia_ and _Sierraleon_, in the Straits and\\nChannels of _Benin_, and in general along the whole Coast, the Flowings are\\nregular on the Shores, with this Difference; that, in the abovemention'd\\nRivers, and in the Channels of _Benin_, where the Shore contract the Waters\\ninto a narrow Compass, the Tides are strong and high, as well as regular;\\nbut on the dead Coast, where it makes an equal Reverberation, slow and low,\\n(not to above two or three Foot,) increasing as you advance towards\\n_Benin_; and this is farther evident in that at Cape _Corso, Succonda_ and\\n_Commenda_, and where the Land rounds and gives any Stop, the Tides flow\\nregularly to four Foot and upwards; when on an evener Coast, (tho' next\\nadjoining,) they shall not exceed two or three Foot; and ten Leagues out at\\nSea, (where no such Interruption is,) they become scarcely, if at all,\\nperceptible.\\n\\nWhat I would deduce from this, besides a Confirmation of that ingenious\\nTheory of the Tides, by Captain _Halley_; is first, that the Ships bound to\\n_Angola, Cabenda_, and other Places on the Southern Coast of _Africa_,\\nshould cross the _Æquinoctial_ from Cape _Palmas_, and run into a Southern\\nLatitude, without keeping too far to the Westward; and the Reason seems\\nplain, for if you endeavour to cross it about the Islands, you meet Calms,\\nsoutherly Winds and opposite Currents; and if too far to the Westward, the\\ntrade Winds are strong and unfavourable; for it obliges you to stand into\\n28 or 30° Southern Latitude, till they are variable.\\n\\nSecondly, On the Northern Side of _Guiney_, if Ships are bound from the\\n_Gold-Coast_ to _Sierraleon, Gambia_, or elsewhere to Windward, considering\\nthe Weakness of these Currents, and the Favourableness of Land Breezes, and\\nSoutherly in the Rains, Turnadoes, and even of the Trade Wind, when\\na-breast of Cape _Palmas_, it is more expeditious to pursue the Passage\\nthis Way, than by a long perambulatory Course of 4 or 500 Leagues to the\\nWestward, and as many more to the Northward, which must be before a Wind\\ncan be obtained, that could recover the Coast.\\n\\nLastly, it is, in a great Measure, owning to this want of Inlets, and the\\nRivers being small and unnavigable, that the Seas rebound with so dangerous\\na Surff thro' the whole Continent.\\n\\nRound the Shores of this Island, and at this Season, _(July, August_ and\\n_September_,) there is a great Resort of Whale-Fish, tame, and sporting\\nvery nigh the Ships as they sail in, always in Pairs, the Female much the\\nsmaller, and often seen to turn on their Backs for Dalliance, the Prologue\\nto engendring: It has an Enemy, called the Thresher, a large Fish too, that\\nhas its Haunts here at this Season, and encounters the Whale, raising\\nhimself out of the Water a considerable Heighth, and falling again with\\ngreat Weight and Force; it is commonly said also, that there is a Sword\\nFish in these Battles, who pricks the Whale up to the Surface again, but\\nwithout this, I believe, he would suffocate when put to quick Motions,\\nunless frequently approaching the Air, to ventilate and remove the\\nimpediments to a swifter Circulation: Nor do I think he is battled for\\nPrey, but to remove him from what is perhaps the Food of both. The Number\\nof Whales here has put me sometimes on thinking an advantageous Fishery\\nmight be made of it, but I presume they (no more than those of _Brasil)_\\nare the Sort which yield the profitable Part, called Whale-Bone: All\\ntherefore that the Islanders do, is now and then to go out with two or\\nthree Canoes, and set on one for Diversion.\\n\\nThe Rocks and outer Lines of the Island, are the Haunts of variety of\\nSea-Birds, especially Boobies and Noddies; the former are of the Bigness of\\na Gull, and a dark Colour, named so from their Simplicity, because they\\noften sit still and let the Sailors take them up in their Hands; but I\\nfancy this succeeds more frequently from their Weariness, and the Largeness\\nof their Wings, which, when they once have rested, cannot have the Scope\\nnecessary to raise and float them on the Air again. The Noddies are smaller\\nand flat footed also.\\n\\nWhat I would remark more of them, is, the admirable Instinct in these\\nBirds, for the proper Seasons, and the proper Places for Support. In the\\naforemention'd Months, when the large Fish were here, numerous Flocks of\\nFowl attend for the Spawn and Superfluity of their Nourishment; and in\\n_January_ few of either; for the same Reason, there are scarce any Sea Fowl\\nseen on the _African_ Coast; Rocks and Islands being generally their best\\nSecurity and Subsistance.\\n\\nThe Harbour of _Princes_ is at the E. S. E. Point of the Island; the\\nNorth-Side has gradual Soundings, but here deep Water, having no Ground at\\na Mile off with 140 Fathom of Line. The Port (when in) is a smooth narrow\\nBay, safe from Winds, (unless a little Swell when Southerly) and draughted\\ninto other smaller and sandy Ones, convenient for raising of Tents,\\nWatering, and hawling the Seam; the whole protected by a Fort, or rather\\nBattery, of a dozen Guns on the Larboard-Side. At the Head of the Bay\\nstands the Town, about a Mile from the anchoring Place, and consists of two\\nor three regular Streets, of wooden built Houses, where the Governor and\\nchief Men of the Island reside. Here the Water grows shallow for a\\nconsiderable Distance, and the Natives, at every Ebb, (having before\\nencompassed every convenient Angle with a Rise of Stones, something like\\nWeirs in _England_) resort for catching of Fish, which, with them, is a\\ndaily Diversion, as well as Subsistance, 500 attending with Sticks and\\nwicker Baskets; and if they cannot dip them with one Hand, they knock them\\ndown with the other. The Tides rise regularly 6 Foot in the Harbour, and\\nyet not half that Heighth without the Capes that make the Bay.\\n\\nHere are constantly two Missionaries, who are sent for six Years to\\ninculcate the Christian Principles, and more especially attend the\\nConversion of the Negroes; the present are _Venetians_, ingenious Men, who\\nseem to despise the loose Morals and Behaviour of the Seculars, and\\ncomplain of them as of the Slaves, _ut Color Mores sunt nigri_. They have a\\nneat Conventual-House and a Garden appropriated, which, by their own\\nIndustry and Labour, not only thrives with the several Natives of the Soil,\\nbut many Exoticks and Curiosities. A Fruit in particular, larger than a\\nChesnut, yellow, containing two Stones, with a Pulp, or clammy Substance\\nabout them, which, when suck'd, exceeds in Sweetness, Sugar or Honey, and\\nhas this Property beyond them, of giving a sweet Taste to every Liquid you\\nswallow for the whole Evening after. The only Plague infesting the Garden,\\nis a Vermin called Land-Crabs, in vast Numbers, of a bright red Colour, (in\\nother Respects like the Sea ones) which burrough in these sandy Soils like\\nRabbets, and are as shy.\\n\\nThe Island is a pleasant Intermixture of Hill and Valley; the Hills spread\\nwith Palms, Coco-Nuts, and Cotton-Trees, with Numbers of Monkeys and\\nParrots among them; the Valleys with fruitful Plantations of _Yamms,\\nKulalu, Papas_, Variety of Sallating, _Ananas_, or Pine-Apples, _Guavas,\\nPlantanes, Bonanas, Manyocos_, and _Indian_ Corn; with Fowls, _Guinea_\\nHens, _Muscovy_ Ducks, Goats, Hogs, Turkies, and wild Beefs, with each a\\nlittle Village of Negroes, who, under the Direction of their several\\nMasters, manage the Cultivation, and exchange or sell them for Money, much\\nafter the same Rates with the People of St. _Thome_.\\n\\nI shall run a Description of the Vegetables, with their Properties, not\\nonly because they are the Produce of this Island, but most of them of\\n_Africa_ in general.\\n\\nThe Palm-Trees are numerous on the Shores of _Africa_, and may be reckoned\\nthe first of their natural Curiosities, in that they afford them Meat,\\nDrink and Cloathing; they grow very straight to 40 and 50 Foot high, and at\\nthe top (only) have 3 or 4 Circles of Branches, that spread and make a\\ncapacious Umbrella. The Trunk is very rough with Knobs, either\\nExcrescencies, or the Healings of those Branches that were lopped off to\\nforward the Growth of the Tree, and make it answer better in its Fruit. The\\nBranches are strongly tied together with a _Cortex_, which may be\\nunravelled to a considerable Length and Breadth; the inward _Lamella_ of\\nthis _Cortex_, I know are wove like a Cloath at _Benin_, and afterwards\\ndied and worn: Under the Branches, and close to the Body of the Tree, hang\\nthe Nuts, thirty Bunches perhaps on a Tree, and each of thirty Pound\\nWeight, with prickly Films from between them, not unresembling Hedge-Hogs;\\nof these Nuts comes a liquid and pleasant scented Oyl, used as Food and\\nSauce all over the Coast, but chiefly in the Windward Parts of _Africa_,\\nwhere they stamp, boil and skim it off in great Quantities; underneath,\\nwhere the Branches fasten, they tap for Wine, called _Cockra_, in this\\nManner; the Negroes who are mostly limber active Fellows, encompass\\nthemselves and the Trees with a Hoop of strong With, and run up with a\\ngreat deal of Agility; at the Bottom of a Branch of Nuts, he makes an\\nExcavation of an Inch and a half over, and tying fast his Calabash, leaves\\nit to destil, which it does to two or three Quarts in a Night's Time, when\\ndone he plugs it up, and chooses another; for if suffered to run too much,\\nor in the Day Time, the Sap is unwarily exhausted, and the Tree spoiled:\\nThe Liquor thus drawn, is of a wheyish Colour, intoxicating and sours in 24\\nHours, but when new drawn, is _pleasantest to thirst and hunger both_: It\\nis from these Wines they draw their Arack in _India_. On the very Top of\\nthe Palm, grows a Cabbage, called so, I believe, from some resemblance its\\nTast is thought to have with ours, and is used like it; the Covering has a\\nDown that makes the best of Tinder, and the Weavings of other Parts are\\ndrawn out into strong Threads.\\n\\n_Coco-Nut-Trees_ are branch'd like, but not so tall as, _Palm_ Trees, the\\nNut like them, growing under the Branches, and close to the Trunk; the\\nmilky Liquor they contain, (to half a Pint or more,) is often drank to\\nquench Thirst, but surfeiting, and this may be observed in their Way of\\nNourishment, that when the Quantity of Milk is large, the Shell and Meat\\nare very thin, and harden and thicken in Proportion, as that loses.\\n\\n_Cotton_ Trees also are the Growth of all Parts of _Africk_, as well as the\\nIslands, of vast Bigness, yet not so incremental as the Shrubs or Bushes of\\nfive or six Foot high; these bear a Fruit (if it may be so called) about\\nthe Bigness of Pigeons Eggs, which as the Sun swells and ripens, bursts\\nforth and discovers three Cells loaded with Cotton, and Seeds in the Middle\\nof them: This in most Parts the Negroes know how to spin, and here at\\n_Nicongo_ and the Island St. _Jago_, how to weave into Cloths.\\n\\n_Yamms_ are a common Root, sweeter but not unlike Potato's: _Kulalu_, a\\nHerb like Spinnage: _Papa_, a Fruit less than the smallest Pumkins; they\\nare all three for boiling, and to be eat with Meat; the latter are improved\\nby the _English_ into a Turnip or an Apple Tast, with a due Mixture of\\nButter or Limes.\\n\\n_Guava's_, a Fruit as large as a Pipin, with Seeds and Stones in it, of an\\nuncouth astringing Tast, tho' never so much be said in Commendation of it,\\nat the _West-Indies_, it is common for _Cræolians_, (who has tasted both,)\\nto give it a Preference to Peach or Nectarine, no amazing Thing when Men\\nwhose Tasts are so degenerated, as to prefer a Toad in a Shell, (as _Ward_\\ncalls Turtle,) to Venison, and Negroes to fine _English_ Ladies.\\n\\n_Plantanes_ and _Bonano's_ are Fruit of oblong Figure, that I think differ\\nonly _secundum Major & Minus_, if any, the latter are preferable, and by\\nbeing less, are juicier; they are usually, when stripped of their Coat, eat\\nat Meals instead of Bread: The Leaf of this Plantane is an admirable\\nDetergent, and, externally applied, I have seen cure the most obstinate\\nscorbutick Ulcers.\\n\\n_Manyoco_. A Root that shoots its Branches about the heighth of a Currant\\nBush; from this Root the Islanders make a Farine or Flower, which they sell\\nat three Ryals a Roove, and drive a considerable Trade for it with the\\nShips that call in. The manner of making it, is first to press the Juice\\nfrom it, (which is poisonous) done here with Engines, and then the Negroe\\nWomen, upon a rough Stone, rub it into a granulated Flower, reserved in\\ntheir Houses, either to boil, as we do our Wheat, and is a hearty Food for\\nthe Slaves; or make it into a Bread, fine, white, and well tasted, for\\nthemselves. One thing worth taking Notice about _Manyoco_ in this Island,\\nis, that the Woods abound with a wild poisonous and more mortiferous Sort,\\nwhich sometimes Men, unskilled in the Preparation of it, feed on to their\\nDestruction: This the Missionaries assured me they often experimented in\\ntheir Hogs, and believed we did in the Mortality of our Sailors.\\n\\n_Indian Corn_, is likewise as well as the _Farine de Manyoco_ and Rice, the\\ncommon Victualling of our Slave Ships, and is afforded here at 1000 Heads\\nfor two Dollars. This Corn grows eight or nine Foot high, on a hard Reed or\\nStick, shooting forth at every six Inches Heighth, some long Leaves; it has\\nalways an Ear, or rather Head, at top, of, perhaps, 400 Fold Increase; and\\noften two, three, or more, Midway.\\n\\nHere are some Tamarind Trees; another called _Cola_, whose Fruit, or Nut\\n(about twice the Bigness of a Chestnut, and bitter) is chewed by the\\n_Portugueze_, to give a sweet Gust to their Water which they drink; but\\nabove all, I was shewn the Bark of one (whose Name I do not know) gravely\\naffirm'd to have a peculiar Property of enlarging the Virile Member; I am\\nnot fond of such Conceits, nor believe it in the Power of any Vegetables,\\nbut must acknowledge, I have seen Sights of this kind among the Negroes\\nvery extraordinary; yet, that there may be no Wishes among the Ladies for\\nthe Importation of this Bark, I must acquaint them, that they are found to\\ngrow less merry, as they encrease in Bulk. I had like to have forgot their\\nCinnamon Trees; there is only one Walk of them, and is the Entrance of the\\nGovernor's Villa; they thrive extreemly well, and the Bark not inferior to\\nour Cinnamon from _India_; why they and other Spice, in a Soil so proper,\\nreceive no farther Cultivation, is, probably, their Suspicion, that so rich\\na Produce, might make some potent Neighbour take a Fancy to the Island.\\n\\nThey have two Winters, or rather Springs, and two Summers: Their Winters,\\nwhich are the rainy Seasons, come in _September_ and _February_, or\\n_March_, and hold two Months, returning that Fatness and generative Power\\nto the Earth, as makes it yield a double Crop every Year, with little Sweat\\nor Labour.\\n_Hic Ver Assiduum atque Alienis Mensibus Æstas --Bis gravidæ\\nPecudes, bis Pomis utilis arbos_.\\n\\nTheir first coming is with _Travado_'s, _i. e._ sudden and hard Gusts of\\nWind, with Thunder, Lightning and heavy Showers, but short; and the next\\nnew or full Moon at those Times of the Year, infallibly introduces the\\nRains, which once begun, fall with little Intermission, and are observed\\ncoldest in _February_. Similar to these are rainy Seasons also over all the\\nCoast of _Africa_: If there may be allowed any general Way of calculating\\ntheir Time, they happen from the Course of the Sun, as it respects the\\n_Æquinoctial_ only; for if these _Æquinoxes_ prove rainy Seasons all over\\nthe World (as I am apt to think they are) whatever secret Cause operates\\nwith that Station of the Sun to produce them, will more effectually do it\\nin those vicine Latitudes; and therefore, as the Sun advances, the Rains\\nare brought on the _Whydah_ and Gold Coast, by _April_, and on the\\nWindwardmost Part of _Guiney_ by _May_: The other Season of the Sun's\\nreturning to the Southward, make them more uncertain and irregular in\\nNorthern _Africa_; but then to the Southward again, they proceed in like\\nmanner, and are at Cape _Lopez_ in _October_, at _Angola_ in _November_,\\n&c.\\n\\nThe Manner of living among the _Portugueze_ here is, with the utmost\\nFrugality and Temperance, even to Penury and Starving; a familiar Instance\\nof Proof is, in the Voracity of their Dogs, who finding such clean\\nCupboards at home, are wild in a manner with Hunger, and tare up the Graves\\nof the Dead for Food, as I have often seen: They themselves are lean with\\nCovetousness, and that Christian Vertue, which is often the Result of it,\\nSelfdenyal; and would train up their Cattle in the same way, could they\\nfetch as much Money, or had not they their Provision more immediately of\\nProvidence. The best of them (excepting the Governor now and then) neither\\npay nor receive any Visits of Escapade or Recreation; they meet and sit\\ndown at each others Doors in the Street every Evening, and as few of them,\\nin so small an Island, can have their Plantations at any greater Distance,\\nthan that they may see it every Day if they will, so the Subject of their\\nTalk is mostly how Affairs went there, with their Negroes, or their Ground,\\nand then part with one another innocently, but empty.\\n\\nThe Negroes have yet no hard Duty with them, they are rather Happy in\\nSlavery; for as their Food is chiefly Vegetables, that could no way else be\\nexpended, there is no Murmurs bred on that account; and as their Business\\nis Domestick, either in the Services of the House, or in Gardening, Sowing,\\nor Planting, they have no more than what every Man would prefer for Health\\nand Pleasure; the hardest of their Work is the Carriage of their Pateroons,\\nor their Wives, to and from the Plantations; this they do in Hammocks\\n(call'd at _Whydah, Serpentines_) slung cross a Pole, with a Cloath over,\\nto screen the Person, so carried, from Sun and Weather, and the Slaves are\\nat each End; and yet even this, methinks, is better than the specious\\nLiberty a Man has for himself and his Heirs to work in a Coal Mine.\\n\\nThe Negroes are, most of them, thro' the Care of their Patroons,\\nChristians, at least nominal, but excepting to some few, they adhere still\\nto many silly Pagan Customs in their Mournings and Rejoycings, and in some\\nMeasure, powerful Majority has introduced them with the Vulgar of the\\n_Mulatto_ and _Portugueze_ Race.\\n\\nIf a Person die in that Colour, the Relations and Friends of him meet at\\nthe House, where the Corpse is laid out decently on the Ground and covered\\n(all except the Face) with a Sheet; they sit round it, crying and howling\\ndreadfully, not unlike what our Countrymen are said to do in _Ireland_:\\nThis Mourning lasts for eight Days and Nights, but not equally intense, for\\nas the Friends, who compose the Chorus, go out and in, are weary, and\\nunequally affected, the Tone lessens daily, and the Intervals of Grief are\\nlonger.\\n\\nIn Rejoycings and Festivals they are equally ridiculous; these are commonly\\nmade on some Friend's Escape from Shipwreck, or other Danger: They meet in\\na large Room of the House, with a Strum Strum, to which one of the Company,\\nperhaps, sings wofully; the rest standing round the Room close to the\\nPetitions, take it in their Turns (one or two at a time) to step round,\\ncalled Dancing, the whole clapping their Hands continually, and hooping out\\nevery Minute _Abeo_, which signify no more, than, _how do you_. And this\\nfoolish Mirth will continue three or four Days together at a House, and\\nperhaps twelve or sixteen Hours at a time.\\n\\nThe _Portugueze_, tho' eminently abstemious and temperate in all other\\nThings, are unbounded in their Lusts; and perhaps they substitute the\\nformer in room of a Surgeon, as a Counterpoison to the Mischiefs of a\\npromiscuous Salacity: They have most of them Venereal Taints, and with Age\\nbecome meager and hectick: I saw two Instances here of Venereal Ulcers that\\nhad cancerated to the Bowels, Spectacles that would have effectually\\nperswaded Men (I think) how Salutary the Restriction of Laws are.\\n\\n_Annobono_ is the last, and of the least Consequence of the three Islands;\\nthere are Plenty of Fruits and Provisions, exchanged to Ships for old\\nCloaths and Trifles of any Sort; they have a Governor nominated from St.\\n_Thome_, and two or three Priests, neither of which are minded, every one\\nliving at Discretion, and fill'd with Ignorance and Lust.\\n\\n                                * * *\\n\\nTo return to _Davis_, the next Day after he left _Anamaboe_, early in the\\nMorning, the Man at the Mast-Head espied a Sail. It must be observed, they\\nkeep a good Look-out; for, according to their Articles, he who first espies\\na Sail, if she proves a Prize, is entitled to the best Pair of Pistols on\\nBoard, over and above his Dividend, in which they take a singular Pride;\\nand a Pair of Pistols has sometimes been sold for thirty Pounds, from one\\nto another.\\n\\nImmediately they gave Chace, and soon came up with her; the Ship proved to\\nbe a _Hollander_, and being betwixt _Davis_ and the Shore, she made all the\\nSail she could, intending to run aground; _Davis_ guessed her Design, and\\nputting out all his small Sails, came up with her before she could effect\\nit, and fired a Broad-side, upon which she immediately struck, and called\\nfor Quarter. It was granted, for according to _Davis_'s Articles, it was\\nagreed, that Quarter should be given whenever it was called for, upon Pain\\nof Death. This Ship proved a very rich Prize, having the Governor of _Acra_\\non Board, with all his Effects, going to _Holland_; there was in Money to\\nthe Value of 15000 _l._ Sterling, besides other valuable Merchandizes, all\\nwhich they brought on Board of themselves.\\n\\nUpon this new Success, they restored Captain _Hall_ and Captain _Plumb_,\\nbefore-mentioned, their Ships again, but strengthened their Company with\\nthirty five Hands, all white Men, taken out of these two and the _Morrice_\\nSloop; they also restored the _Dutch_ their Ship, after having plunder'd\\nher, as is mentioned.\\n\\nBefore they got to the Island of _Princes_, one of their Ships, _viz._ that\\ncall'd the _King James_, sprung a Leak; _Davis_ order'd all Hands out of\\nher, on Board his own Ship, with every thing else of Use, and left her at\\nan Anchor at _High Cameroon_. As soon as he came in Sight of the Island, he\\nhoisted _English_ Colours; the _Portuguese_ observing a large Ship sailing\\ntowards them, sent out a little Sloop to examine what she might be; this\\nSloop hailing of _Davis_, he told them he was an _English_ Man of War, in\\nQuest of Pyrates, and that he had received Intelligence there were some\\nupon that Coast; upon this they received him as a welcome Guest, and\\npiloted him into the Harbour. He saluted the Fort, which they answered, and\\nhe came to an Anchor just under their Guns, and hoisted out the Pinnace,\\nMan of War Fashion, ordering nine Hands and a Coxen in it, to row him\\nashore.\\n\\nThe _Portugueze_, to do him the greater Honour, sent down a File of\\nMusqueteers to receive him, and conduct him to the Governor. The Governor\\nnot in the least suspecting what he was, received him very civilly,\\npromising to supply him with whatever the Island afforded; _Davis_ thanked\\nhim, telling him, the King of _England_ would pay for whatever he should\\ntake; so after several Civilities pass'd between him and the Governor, he\\nreturned again on Board.\\n\\nIt happened a _French_ Ship came in there to supply it self with some\\nNecessaries, which _Davis_ took into his Head to plunder, but to give the\\nThing a Colour of Right, he persuaded the _Portugueze_, that she had been\\ntrading with the Pyrates, and that he found several Pyrates Goods on Board,\\nwhich he seized for the King's Use: This Story passed so well upon the\\nGovernor, that he commended _Davis_'s Diligence.\\n\\nA few Days after, _Davis_, with about fourteen more, went privately ashore,\\nand walk'd up the Country towards a Village, where the Governor and the\\nother chief Men of the Island kept their Wives, in tending, as we may\\nsuppose, to supply their Husbands Places with them; but being discovered,\\nthe Women fled to a neighbouring Wood, and _Davis_ and the rest retreated\\nto their Ship, without effecting their Design: The Thing made some Noise,\\nbut as no body knew them, it passed over.\\n\\nHaving cleaned his Ship, and put all Things in Order, his Thoughts now were\\nturned upon the main Business, _viz._ the Plunder of the Island, and not\\nknowing where the Treasure lay, a Stratagem came into his Head, to get it\\n(as he thought) with little Trouble, he consulted his Men upon it, and they\\nliked the Design: His Scheme was, to make a Present to the Governor, of a\\nDozen Negroes, by Way of Return for the Civilities received from him, and\\nafterwards to invite him, with the chief Men, and some of the Friers, on\\nBoard his Ship, to an Entertainment; the Minute they came on Board, they\\nwere to be secured in Irons, and there kept till they should pay a Ransom\\nof 40000 _l._ Sterling.\\n\\nBut this Stratagem proved fatal to him, for a _Portugueze_ Negroe swam\\nashore in the Night, and discovered the whole Plot to the Governor, and\\nalso let him know, that it was _Davis_ who had made the Attempt upon their\\nWives. However, the Governor dissembled, received the Pyrates Invitation\\ncivilly, and promised that he and the rest would go.\\n\\nThe next Day _Davis_ went on Shore himself, as if it were out of greater\\nRespect to bring the Governor on Board: He was received with the usual\\nCivility, and he, and other principal Pyrates, who, by the Way, had assumed\\nthe Title of Lords, and as such took upon them to advise or councel their\\nCaptain upon any important Occasion; and likewise held certain Priviledges,\\nwhich the common Pyrates were debarr'd from, as walking the Quarter-Deck,\\nusing the great Cabin, going ashore at Pleasure, and treating with foreign\\nPowers, that is, with the Captains of Ships they made Prize of; I say,\\n_Davis_ and some of the Lords were desired to walk up to the Governor's\\nHouse, to take some Refreshment before they went on Board; they accepted it\\nwithout the least Suspicion, but never returned again; for an Ambuscade was\\nlaid, a Signal being given, a whole Volley was fired upon them; they every\\nMan dropp'd, except one, this one fled back, and escaped into the Boat, and\\ngot on Board the Ship: _Davis_ was shot through the Bowels, yet he rise\\nagain, and made a weak Effort to get away, but his Strength soon forsook\\nhim, and he dropp'd down dead; just as he fell, he perceived he was\\nfollowed, and drawing out his Pistols, fired them at his Pursuers; Thus\\nlike a game Cock, giving a dying Blow, that he might not fall unrevenged.\\n\\nCHAP. IX. OF Captain _Bartho. Roberts_, And his CREW.\\n\\nB_Artholomew Roberts_ sailed in an honest Employ, from _London_\\naboard of the _Princess_, Captain _Plumb_ Commander, of which Ship he was\\nsecond Mate: He left _England, November_ 1719, and arrived at _Guiney_\\nabout _February_ following, and being at _Anamaboe_, taking in Slaves for\\nthe _West-Indies_, was taken in the said Ship by Captain _Howel Davis_, as\\nmentioned in the preceeding Chapter. In the beginning he was very averse to\\nthis sort of Life, and would certainly have escaped from them, had a fair\\nOpportunity presented it self; yet afterwards he changed his Principles, as\\nmany besides him have done upon another Element, and perhaps for the same\\nReason too, _viz._ Preferment,--and what he did not like as a private Man\\nhe could reconcile to his Conscience as a Commander.\\n\\n_Davis_ being cut off in the manner beforementioned, the Company found\\nthemselves under a Necessity of filling up his Post, for which there\\nappear'd two or three Candidates among the select Part of them, that were\\ndistinguish'd by the Title of Lords, such were _Sympson, Ashplant, Anstis_,\\n&c. and on canvassing this Matter, how shatter'd and weak a Condition their\\nGovernment must be without a Head, since _Davis_ had been remov'd, in the\\nmanner beforemention'd, my Lord _Dennis_ propos'd, its said, over a Bowl to\\nthis Purpose.\\n\\n_That it was not of any great Signification who was dignify'd with Title;\\nfor really and in Truth, all good Governments had_ (_like theirs_) _the\\nsupream Power lodged with the Community, who might doubtless depute and\\nrevoke as suited Interest or Humour. We are the Original of this Claim_\\n(says he) _and should a Captain be so sawcy as to exceed Prescription at\\nany time_, why down with Him! _it will be a Caution after he is dead to his\\nSuccessors, of what fatal Consequence any sort of assuming may be. However,\\nit is my Advice, that, while we are sober, we pitch upon a Man of Courage,\\nand skill'd in Navigation, one, who by his Council and Bravery seems best\\nable to defend this Commonwealth, and ward us from the Dangers and Tempests\\nof an instable Element, and the fatal Consequences of Anarchy; and such a\\none I take_ Roberts _to be. A Fellow! I think, in all Respects, worthy your\\nEsteem and Favour_.\\n\\nThis Speech was loudly applauded by all but Lord _Sympson_, who had secret\\nExpectations himself, but on this Disappointment, grew sullen, and left\\nthem, swearing, _he did not care who they chose Captain, so it was not a\\nPapist, for against them he had conceiv'd an irreconcileable Hatred, for\\nthat his Father had been a Sufferer in_ Monmouth_'s Rebellion_.\\n\\n_Roberts_ was accordingly elected, tho' he had not been above six Weeks\\namong them, the Choice was confirm'd both by the Lords and Commoners, and\\nhe accepted of the Honour, saying, _That since he had dipp'd his Hands in\\nmuddy Water, and must be a Pyrate, it was better being a Commander than a\\ncommon Man_.\\n\\nAs soon as the Government was settled, by promoting other Officers in the\\nroom of those that were kill'd by the _Portugueze_, the Company resolv'd to\\nrevenge Captain _Davis_'s Death, he being more than ordinarily respected by\\nthe Crew for his Affability and good Nature, as well as his Conduct and\\nBravery upon all Occasions; and pursuant to this Resolution, about 30 Men\\nwere landed in order to make an Attack upon the Fort, which must be\\nascended to by a steep Hill against the Mouth of the Cannon. These Men were\\nheaded by one _Kennedy_, a bold daring Fellow, but very wicked and\\nprofligate; they march'd directly up under the Fire of their Ship Guns, and\\nas soon as they were discover'd, the _Portugueze_ quitted their Post and\\nfled to the Town, and the Pyrates march'd in without Opposition, set Fire\\nto the Fort, and threw all the Guns off the Hill into the Sea, which after\\nthey had done, they retreated quietly to their Ship.\\n\\nBut this was not look'd upon as a sufficient Satisfaction for the Injury\\nthey received, therefore most of the Company were for burning the Town,\\nwhich _Roberts_ said he would yield to, if any Means could be proposed of\\ndoing it without their own Destruction, for the Town had a securer\\nScituation than the Fort, a thick Wood coming almost close to it, affording\\nCover to the Defendants, who under such an Advantage, he told them, it was\\nto be fear'd, would fire and stand better to their Arms; besides, that bare\\nHouses would be but a slender Reward for their Trouble and Loss. This\\nprudent Advice prevailed; however, they mounted the _French_ Ship, they\\nseiz'd at this Place, with 12 Guns, and light'ned her, in order to come up\\nto the Town, the Water being shoal, and battered down several Houses; after\\nwhich they all returned on Board, gave back the _French_ Ship to those that\\nhad most Right to her, and sailed out of the Harbour by the light of two\\n_Portuguese_ Ships, which they were pleased to set on Fire there.\\n\\n_Roberts_ stood away to the Southward, and met with a _Dutch Guiney_ Man,\\nwhich he made Prize of, but after having plundered her, the Skipper had his\\nShip again: Two Days after, he took an _English_ Ship, called the\\n_Experiment_, Captain _Cornet_, at _Cape Lopez_, the Men went all into the\\nPyrate Service, and having no Occasion for the Ship, they burnt her, and\\nthen steered for St. _Thome_, but meeting with nothing in their Way, they\\nsailed for _Annabona_, and there water'd, took in Provisions, and put it to\\na Vote of the Company, whether their next Voyage should be, to the\\n_East-Indies_, or to _Brasil_; the latter being resolved on, they sailed\\naccordingly, and in 28 Days arrived at _Ferdinando_, an uninhabited Island,\\non that Coast: Here they water'd, boot-top'd their Ship, and made ready for\\nthe designed Cruise.\\n\\nNow that we are upon this Coast, I think it will be the proper Place to\\npresent our Readers with a Description of this Country, and some ingenious\\nRemarks of a Friend, how beneficial a Trade might be carried on here by our\\n_West-India_ Merchants, at a little Hazard.\\n\\nA DESCRIPTION OF _BRASIL_, &c.\\n\\nB_RASIL_ (a Name signifying the holy Cross) was discovered for the\\nKing of _Portugal_, by _Alvarez Cabral, Ann. Dom._ 1501. extending almost\\nfrom the _Æquinoctial_ to 28° South. The Air is temperate and cool, in\\ncomparison of the _West-Indies_, from stronger Breezes and an opener\\nCountry, which gives less Interruption to the Winds.\\n\\nThe northernmost Part of it stretching about 180 Leagues, (a fine fertile\\nCountry,) was taken from the _Portuguese_ by the _Dutch West-India_\\nCompany, _Anno._ 1637 or thereabouts; but the Conquerors, as is natural\\nwhere there is little or no Religion subsisting, made such heavy Exactions\\non the _Portuguese_, and extended such Cruelty to the Natives, that\\nprepared them both easily to unite for a Revolt, facilitated by the _Dutch_\\nMismanagement: For the States being at this Time very intent on their\\n_India_ Settlements, not only recalled Count _Morrice_ their Governor, but\\nneglected Supplies to their Garrisons; however, tho' the others were\\ncountenanced with a Fleet from _Portugal_, and had the Affection of the\\nNatives, yet they found Means to withstand and struggle with this superior\\nPower, from 1643 to 1660, and then was wholly abandoned by them, on\\nArticles dishonourable to the _Portuguese_, viz.\\n\\nThat the _Dutch_, on Relinquishing, should keep all the Places they had\\nconquered in _India_ from _Portugal_. That they should pay the States\\n800000 _l._ and permit them still the Liberty of Trade to _Africa_ and\\n_Brasil_, on the same Custom and Duties with the King of _Portugal_'s\\nSubjects. But since that Time, new Stipulations and Treaties have been\\nmade; wherein the _Dutch_, who have been totally excluded the _Brasil_\\nTrade, have, in lieu thereof, a Composition of 10 _per Cent_. for the\\nLiberty of trading to _Africa_; and this is always left by every\\n_Portuguese_ Ship (before she begins her Slaving) with the _Dutch_ General\\nof the _Gold-Coast_, at _Des Minas_.\\n\\nThere are only three principal Towns of Trade on the _Brasil_ Coast, St.\\n_Salvadore_, St. _Sebastian_, and _Pernambuca_.\\n\\nSt. _Salvadore_ in the _Bahia los todos Santos_, is an Archbishoprick and\\nSeat of the Viceroy, the chief Port of Trade for Importation, where most of\\nthe Gold from the Mines is lodged, and whence the Fleets for _Europe_\\ngenerally depart. The Seas about it abound with Whale-Fish, which in the\\nSeason they catch in great Numbers; the Flesh is salted up generally to be\\nthe Victualling of their Slave-Ships, and the Train reserved for\\nExportation, at 30 and 35 Millrays a Pipe.\\n\\n_Rio Janeiro (_the Town St. _Sebastian)_ is the Southernmost of the\\n_Portuguese_, the worst provided of Necessaries, but commodious for a\\nSettlement, because nigh the Mine, and convenient to supervise the Slaves,\\nwho, as I have been told, do usually allow their Master a Dollar _per\\nDiem_, and have the Overplus of their Work (if any) to themselves.\\n\\nThe Gold from hence is esteemed the best, (for being of a copperish\\nColour,) and they have a Mint to run it into Coin, both here and at\\n_Bahia_; the Moidors of either having the initial Letters of each Place\\nupon them.\\n\\n_Pernambuca_ (tho' mention'd last) is the second in Dignity, a large and\\npopulous Town, and has its rise from the Ruins of _Olinda_, (or the\\nhandsome,) a City of a far pleasanter Situation, six Miles up the River,\\nbut not so commodious for Traffick and Commerce. Just above the Town the\\nRiver divides it self into two Branches, not running directly into the Sea,\\nbut to the Southward; and in the Nook of the Island made by that Division,\\nstands the Governor's House, a square plain Building of Prince _Maurice_'s,\\nwith two Towers, on which are only this Date inscribed, _Anno_ 1641. The\\nAvenues to it are every way pleasant, thro' Visto's of tall Coco-Nut Trees.\\n\\nOver each Branch of the River is a Bridge; that leading to the Country is\\nall of Timber, but the other to the Town (of twenty six or twenty eight\\nArches) is half of Stone, made by the _Dutch_, who in their Time had little\\nShops and gaming Houses on each Side for Recreation.\\n\\nThe Pavements also of the Town are in some Places of broad Tiles, the\\nremaining Fragments of their Conquest. The Town has the outer Branch of the\\nRiver behind it, and the Harbour before it, jetting into which latter are\\nclose Keys for the weighing and receiving of Customage on Merchandize, and\\nfor the meeting and conferring of Merchants and Traders. The Houses are\\nstrong built, but homely, letticed like those of _Lisbon_, for the\\nAdmission of Air, without Closets, and what is worse, Hearths; which makes\\ntheir Cookery consist all in frying and stewing upon Stoves; and that they\\ndo till the Flesh become tender enough to shake it to Pieces, and one Knife\\nis then thought sufficient to serve a Table of half a Score.\\n\\nThe greatest Inconvenience of _Pernambuca_ is, that there is not one\\nPublick-House in it; so that Strangers are obliged to hire any ordinary one\\nthey can get, at a Guinea a Month: And others who come to transact Affairs\\nof Importance, must come recommended, if it were only for the sake of\\nPrivacy.\\n\\nThe Market is stocked well enough, Beef being at five Farthings _per l_. a\\nSheep or Goat at nine Shillings, a Turkey four Shillings, and Fowls two\\nShillings, the largest I ever saw, and may be procured much Cheaper, by\\nhiring a Man to fetch them out of the Country. The dearest in its kind is\\nWater, which being fetch'd in Vessels from _Olinda_, will not be put on\\nBoard in the Road under two Crusado's a Pipe.\\n\\nThe _Portuguese_ here are darker than those of _Europe_, not only from a\\nwarmer Climate, but their many Intermarriages with the Negroes, who are\\nnumerous there, and some of them of good Credit and Circumstances. The\\nWomen (not unlike the Mulatto Generation every where else) are fond of\\nStrangers; not only the Courtezans, whose Interest may be supposed to wind\\nup their Affections, but also the marryed Women who think themselves\\nobliged, when you favour them with the Secrecy of an Appointment; but the\\nUnhappiness of pursuing Amours, is, that the generallity of both Sexes are\\ntouched with veneral Taints, without so much as one Surgeon among them, or\\nany Body skilled in Physick, to cure or palliate the progressive Mischief:\\nThe only Person pretending that Way, is an _Irish_ Father, whose Knowledge\\nis all comprehended in the Virtues of two or three Simples, and those, with\\nthe Salubrity of the Air and Temperance, is what they depend on, for\\nsubduing the worst of Malignity; and it may not be unworthy Notice, that\\ntho' few are exempted from the Misfortune of a Running, Eruptions, or the\\nlike, yet I could hear of none precipitated into those deplorable\\nCircumstances we see common in unskillful mercurial Processes.\\n\\nThere are three Monasteries, and about six Churches, none of them Rich or\\nMagnificent, unless one dedicated to St. _Antonio_, the Patron of their\\nKingdom, which shines all over with exquisite Pieces of Paint and Gold.\\n\\nThe Export of _Brasil_ (besides Gold) is chiefly Sugars and Tobacco; the\\nlatter are sent off in Rowls of a Quintal Weight, kept continually\\nmoistened with Mulossus, which, with the Soil it springs from, imparts a\\nstrong and peculiar Scent, more sensible in the Snuff made from it, which\\ntho' under Prohibition of importing to _Lisbon_, sells here at 2 _s. per\\nl_. as the Tobacco does at about 6 Millraies a Rowl. The finest of their\\nSugars sells at 8 _s. per_ Roove, and a small ill tasted Rum drawn from the\\nDregs and Mulossus, at two Testunes a Gallon.\\n\\nBesides these, they send off great Quantities of Brasil Wood, and Whale\\nOyl, some Gums and Parrots, the latter are different from the _African_ in\\nColour and Bigness, for as they are blue and larger, these are green and\\nsmaller; and the Females of them ever retain the wild Note, and cannot be\\nbrought to talk.\\n\\nIn lieu of this Produce, the _Portugueze_, once every Year by their Fleet\\nfrom _Lisbon_, import all manner of European Commodities; and whoever is\\nunable or negligent of supplying himself at that Season, buys at a very\\nadvanced Rate, before the Return of another.\\n\\nTo transport Passengers, Slaves, or Merchandize from one Settlement to\\nanother, or in Fishing; they make use of Bark-Logs, by the _Brasilians_\\ncalled _Jingadahs_: They are made of four Pieces of Timber (the two\\noutermost longest) pinned and fastened together, and sharpened at the Ends:\\nTowards each Extremity a Stool is fixed to sit on for paddling, or holding\\nby, when the Agitation is more than ordinary; with these odd sort of\\nEngines, continually washed over by the Water, do these People, with a\\nlittle triangular Sail spreeted about the Middle of it, venture out of\\nSight of Land, and along the Coasts for many Leagues, in any sort of\\nWeather; and if they overset with a Squall (which is not uncommon) they\\nswim and presently turn it up right again.\\n\\nThe Natives are of the darkest Copper Colour, with thin Hair, of a square\\nstrong make, and muscular; but not so well looking as the Wooley\\nGeneration: They acquiesce patiently to the _Portugueze_ Government, who\\nuse them much more humanly and Christian-like than the _Dutch_ did, and by\\nthat Means have extended Quietness and Peace, as well as their Possessions,\\nthree or four hundred Miles into the Country. A Country abounding with fine\\nPastures and numerous Herds of Cattle, and yields a vast Increase from\\nevery thing that is sown: Hence they bring down to us Parrots, small\\nMonkies, Armadillos and Sanguins, and I have been assured, they have, (far\\nIn-land,) a Serpent of a vast Magnitude, called _Siboya_, able, they say,\\nto swallow a whole Sheep; I have seen my self here the Skin of another\\nSpecie full six Yards long, and therefore think the Story not improbable.\\n\\nThe Harbour of _Pernambuca_ is, perhaps, singular, it is made of a Ledge of\\nRocks, half a Cables length from the Main, and but little above the Surface\\nof the Water, running at that equal Distance and Heighth several Leagues,\\ntowards Cape _Augustine_, a Harbour running between them capable of\\nreceiving Ships of the greatest Burthen: The Northermost End of this Wall\\nof Rock, is higher than any Part of the contiguous Line, on which a little\\nFort is built, commanding the Passage either of Boat or Ship, as they come\\nover the Bar into the Harbour: On the Starboard Side, (_i. e._ the Main)\\nafter you have entered a little way, stands another Fort (a _Pentagon_)\\nthat would prove of small Account, I imagine, against a few disciplined\\nMen; and yet in these consists all their Strength and Security, either for\\nthe Harbour or Town: They have begun indeed a Wall, since their removing\\nfrom _Olinda_, designed to surround the latter; but the slow Progress they\\nmake in raising it, leaves Room to suspect 'twill be a long time in\\nfinishing.\\n\\nThe Road without, is used by the _Portugueze_, when they are nigh sailing\\nfor _Europe_, and wait for the Convoy, or are bound to _Bahia_ to them, and\\nby Strangers only when Necessity compels; the best of it is in ten Fathom\\nWater, near three Miles W. N. W. from the Town; nigher in, is foul with the\\nmany Anchors lost there by the _Portugueze_ Ships; and farther out (in 14\\nFathom) corally and Rocky. _July_ is the worst and Winter Season of this\\nCoast, the Trade Winds being then very strong and dead, bringing in a\\nprodigious and unsafe Swell into the Road, intermixed every Day with\\nSqualls, Rain, and a hazey Horizon, but at other times serener Skies and\\nSunshine.\\n\\nIn these Southern Latitudes is a Constellation, which from some Resemblance\\nit bears to a _Jerusalem_ Cross, has the Name of _Crosiers_, the brightest\\nof this Hemisphere, and are observed by, as the North Star is in Northern\\nLatitudes; but what I mention this for, is, to introduce the admirable\\nPhænomenon in these Seas of the Megellanick Clouds, whose Risings and\\nSittings are so regular, that I have been assured, the same Nocturnal\\nObservations are made by them as by the Stars; They are two Clouds, small\\nand whitish, no larger in Appearance than a Man's Hat, and are seen here in\\n_July_ in the Latitude of 8° S. about four of the Clock in the Morning; if\\ntheir Appearance should be said to be the Reflection of Light, from some\\nStellary Bodies above them, yet the Difficulty is not easily answered, how\\nthese, beyond others, become so durable and regular in their Motions.\\n\\nFrom these casual Observations on the Country, the Towns, Coast, and Seas\\nof _Brasil_, it would be an Omission to leave the Subject, without some\\nEssay on an interloping Slave Trade here, which none of our Countrymen are\\nadventurous enough to pursue, though it very probably, under a prudent\\nManager, would be attended with Safety and very great Profit; and I admire\\nthe more it is not struck at, because Ships from the Southern Coast of\\n_Africa_, don't lengthen the Voyage to the _West-Indies_ a great deal, by\\ntaking a Part of _Brasil_ in their Way.\\n\\nThe Disadvantages the _Portugueze_ are under for purchasing Slaves, are\\nthese, that they have very few proper Commodities for _Guiney_, and the\\nGold, which was their chiefest, by an Edict in _July_ 1722, stands now\\nprohibited from being carried thither, so that the Ships employed therein\\nare few, and insufficient for the great Mortality and Call of their Mines;\\nbesides, should they venture at breaking so destructive a Law, as the\\nabovementioned (as no doubt they do, or they could make little or no\\nPurchace) yet Gold does not raise its Value like Merchandize in travelling\\n(especially to _Africa_) and when the Composition with the _Dutch_ is also\\npaid, they may be said to buy their Negroes at almost double the Price the\\n_English, Dutch_, or _French_ do, which necessarily raises their Value\\nextravagantly at _Brasil_; (those who can purchase one, buying a certainer\\nAnnuity than _South-Sea_ Stock.)\\n\\nThus far of the Call for Slaves at _Brasil_; I shall now consider and\\nobviate some Difficulties objected against any Foreigners (suppose\\n_English_) interposing in such a Trade, and they are some on theirs, and\\nsome on our Side.\\n\\nOn their Side it is prohibited under Pain of Death, a Law less effectual to\\nthe Prevention of it than pecuniary Mulcts would be, because a Penalty so\\ninadequate and disproportioned, is only _In terrorem_, and makes it\\nmerciful in the Governor, or his Instruments, to take a Composition of\\neight or ten Moidors, when any Subject is catched, and is the common Custom\\nso to do as often as they are found out.\\n\\nOn our Side it is Confiscation of what they can get, which considering,\\nthey have no Men of War to guard the Coast, need be very little, without\\nsupine Neglect and Carelessness.\\n\\nI am a Man of War, or Privateer, and being in Want of Provisions, or in\\nSearch of Pyrates, put in to _Pernambuca_ for Intelligence, to enable me\\nfor the Pursuit: The Dread of Pyrates keeps every one off, till you have\\nfirst sent an Officer, with the proper Compliments to the Governor, who\\nimmediately gives Leave for your buying every Necessary you are in want of,\\nprovided it be with Money, and not an Exchange of Merchandize, which is\\nagainst the Laws of the Country.\\n\\nOn this first time of going on Shore, depends the success of the whole\\nAffair, and requires a cautious and discreet Management in the Person\\nentrusted: He will be immediately surrounded at landing with the great and\\nthe small Rabble, to enquire who? and whence he comes? and whether bound?\\n_&c._ and the Men are taught to answer, from _Guiney_, denying any thing of\\na Slave on Board, which are under Hatches, and make no Shew; nor need they,\\nfor those who have Money to lay out will conclude on that themselves.\\n\\nBy that time the Compliment is paid to the Governor, the News has spread\\nall round the Town, and some Merchant addresses you, as a Stranger, to the\\nCivility of his House, but privately desires to know what Negroes he can\\nhave, and what Price. A Governor may possibly use an Instrument in sifting\\nthis, but the Appearance of the Gentleman, and the Circumstance of being so\\nsoon engaged after leaving the other, will go a great way in forming a\\nMan's Judgment, and leaves him no room for the Suspicion of such a Snare;\\nhowever, to have a due Guard, Intimations will suffice, and bring him, and\\nFriends enough to carry off the best Part of a Cargo in two Nights time,\\nfrom 20 to 30 Moidors a Boy, and from 30 to 40 a Man Slave. The Hazard is\\nless at _Rio Janeiro_.\\n\\nThere has been another Method attempted, of settling a Correspondence with\\nsome _Portugueze_ Merchant or two, who, as they may be certain within a\\nFortnight of any Vessels arriving on their Coast with Slaves, might settle\\nSignals for the debarquing them at an unfrequented Part of the Coast, but\\nwhether any Exceptions were made to the Price, or that the _Portuguese_\\ndread Discovery, and the severest Prosecution on so notorious a Breach of\\nthe Law, I cannot tell but it has hither to proved abortive.\\n\\nHowever, Stratagems laudable, and attended with Profit, at no other Hazard\\n(as I can perceive) then loss of Time, are worth attempting; it is what is\\nevery Day practised with the _Spaniards_ from _Jamaica_.\\n\\n                                * * *\\n\\nUpon this Coast our Rovers cruiz'd for about nine Weeks, keeping generally\\nout of Sight of Land, but without seeing a Sail, which discourag'd them so,\\nthat they determined to leave the Station, and steer for the _West-Indies_,\\nand in order thereto, stood in to make the Land for the taking of their\\nDeparture, and thereby they fell in, unexpectedly, with a Fleet of 42 Sail\\nof _Portuguese_ Ships, off the Bay of _los todos Santos_, with all their\\nLading in for _Lisbon_, several of them of good Force, who lay too waiting\\nfor two Men of War of 70 Guns each, their Convoy. However, _Roberts_\\nthought it should go hard with him, but he would make up his Market among\\nthem, and thereupon mix'd with the Fleet, and kept his Men hid till proper\\nResolutions could be form'd; that done, they came close up to one of the\\ndeepest, and ordered her to send the Master on Board quietly, threat'ning\\nto give them no Quarters, if any Resistance, or Signal of Distress was\\nmade. The _Portuguese_ being surprized at these Threats, and the sudden\\nflourish of Cutlashes from the Pyrates, submitted without a Word, and the\\nCaptain came on Board; _Roberts_ saluted him after a friendly manner,\\ntelling him, that they were Gentlemen of Fortune, but that their Business\\nwith him, was only to be informed which was the richest Ship in that Fleet;\\nand if he directed them right, he should be restored to his Ship without\\nMolestation, otherwise, he must expect immediate Death.\\n\\nWhereupon this _Portuguese_ Master pointed to one of 40 Guns, and 150 Men,\\na Ship of greater Force than the _Rover_, but this no Ways dismayed them,\\n_they were_ Portuguese, they said, and so immediately steered away for him.\\nWhen they came within Hail, the Master whom they had Prisoner, was ordered\\nto ask, _how Seignior Capitain did_? And to invite him on Board, _for that\\nhe had a Matter of Consequence to impart to him_, which being done, he\\nreturned for Answer, _That he would wait upon him presently_: But by the\\nBustle that immediately followed, the Pyrates perceived, they were\\ndiscovered, and that this was only a deceitful Answer to gain Time to put\\ntheir Ship in a Posture of Defence; so without further Delay, they poured\\nin a Broad-Side, boarded and grapled her; the Dispute was short and warm,\\nwherein many of the _Portuguese_ fell, and two only of the Pyrates. By this\\nTime the Fleet was alarmed, Signals of Top-gallant Sheets flying, and Guns\\nfired, to give Notice to the Men of War, who rid still at an Anchor, and\\nmade but scurvy hast out to their Assistance; and if what the Pyrates\\nthemselves related, be true, the Commanders of those Ships were blameable\\nto the highest Degree, and unworthy the Title, or so much as the Name of\\nMen: For _Roberts_ finding the Prize to sail heavy, and yet resolving not\\nto loose her, lay by for the headmost of them _(_which much out sailed the\\nother) and prepared for Battle, which was ignominiously declined, tho' of\\nsuch superior Force; for not daring to venture on the Pyrate alone, he\\ntarried so long for his Consort as gave them both time leisurely to make\\noff.\\n\\nThey found this Ship exceeding rich, being laden chiefly with Sugar, Skins,\\nand Tobacco, and in Gold 40000 Moidors, besides Chains and Trinckets, of\\nconsiderable Value; particularly a Cross set with Diamonds, designed for\\nthe King of _Portugal_; which they afterwards presented to the Governor of\\n_Caiana_, by whom they were obliged.\\n\\nElated with this Booty, they had nothing now to think of but some safe\\nRetreat, where they might give themselves up to all the Pleasures that\\nLuxury and Wantonness could bestow, and for the present pitch'd upon a\\nPlace called the _Devil_'s _Islands_, in the River of _Surinam_, on the\\nCoast of _Caiana_, where they arrived, and found the civilest Reception\\nimaginable, not only from the Governor and Factory, but their Wives, who\\nexchanged Wares and drove a considerable Trade with them.\\n\\nThey seiz'd in this River a Sloop, and by her gained Intelligence, that a\\nBrigantine had also sailed in Company with her, from _Rhode-Island_, laden\\nwith Provisions for the Coast. A Welcome Cargo! They growing short in the\\nSea Store, and as _Sancho_ says, _No Adventures to be made without\\nBelly-Timber_. One Evening as they were rumaging (their Mine of Treasure)\\nthe _Portuguese_ Prize, this expected Vessel was descry'd at Mast-Head, and\\n_Roberts_, imagining no Body could do the Business so well as himself,\\ntakes 40 Men in the Sloop, and goes in pursuit of her; but a fatal Accident\\nfollowed this rash, tho' inconsiderable Adventure, for _Roberts_ thinking\\nof nothing less than bringing in the Brigantine that Afternoon, never\\ntroubled his Head about the Sloop's Provision, nor inquired what there was\\non Board to subsist such a Number of Men; but out he sails after his\\nexpected Prize, which he not only lost further Sight of, but after eight\\nDays contending with contrary Winds and Currents, found themselves thirty\\nLeagues to Leeward. The Current still opposing their Endeavours, and\\nperceiving no Hopes of beating up to their Ship, they came to an Anchor,\\nand inconsiderately sent away the Boat to give the rest of the Company\\nNotice of their Condition, and to order the Ship to them; but too soon,\\neven the next Day, their Wants made them sensible of their Infatuation, for\\ntheir Water was all expended, and they had taken no thought how they should\\nbe supply'd, till either the Ship came, or the Boat returned, which was not\\nlikely to be under five or six Days. Here like _Tantalus_, they almost\\nfamished in Sight of the fresh Streams and Lakes; being drove to such\\nExtremity at last, that they were forc'd to tare up the Floor of the Cabin,\\nand patch up a sort of Tub or Tray with Rope Yarns, to paddle ashore, and\\nfetch off immediate Supplies of Water to preserve Life.\\n\\nAfter some Days, the long-wish'd-for Boat came back, but with the most\\nunwellcome News in the World, for _Kennedy_, who was Lieutenant, and left\\nin Absence of _Roberts_, to Command the Privateer and Prize, was gone off\\nwith both. This was Mortification with a Vengeance, and you may imagine,\\nthey did not depart without some hard Speeches from those that were left,\\nand had suffered by their Treachery: And that there need be no further\\nmention of this _Kennedy_, I shall leave Captain _Roberts_, for a Page or\\ntwo, with the Remains of his Crew, to vent their Wrath in a few Oaths and\\nExecrations, and follow the other, whom we may reckon from that Time, as\\nsteering his Course towards _Execution Dock_.\\n\\n_Kennedy_ was now chosen Captain of the revolted Crew, but could not bring\\nhis Company to any determined Resolution; some of them were for pursuing\\nthe old Game, but the greater Part of them seem'd to have Inclinations to\\nturn from those evil Courses, and get home privately, (for there was no Act\\nof Pardon in Force,) therefore they agreed to break up, and every Man to\\nshift for himself, as he should see Occasion. The first Thing they did, was\\nto part with the great _Portugueze_ Prize, and having the Master of the\\nSloop (whose Name I think was _Cane_) aboard, who they said was a very\\nhonest Fellow, (for he had humoured them upon every Occasion,) told them of\\nthe Brigantine that _Roberts_ went after; and when the Pyrates first took\\nhim, he complemented them at an odd Rate, telling them they were welcome to\\nhis Sloop and Cargo, and wish'd that the Vessel had been larger, and the\\nLoading richer for their Sakes: To this good natured Man they gave the\\n_Portugueze_ Ship, (which was then above half loaded,) three or four\\nNegroes, and all his own Men, who returned Thanks to his kind Benefactors,\\nand departed.\\n\\nCaptain _Kennedy_ in the _Rover_, sailed to _Barbadoes_, near which Island,\\nthey took a very peaceable Ship belonging to _Virginia_; the Commander was\\na Quaker, whose Name was _Knot_; he had neither Pistol, Sword, nor Cutlash\\non Board; and Mr. _Knot_ appearing so very passive to all they said to him,\\nsome of them thought this a good Opportunity to go off; and accordingly\\neight of the Pyrates went aboard, and he carried them safe to _Virginia_;\\nThey made the Quaker a Present of 10 Chests of Sugar, 10 Rolls of _Brasil_\\nTobacco, 30 Moidors, and some Gold-Dust, in all to the value of about 250\\n_l._ They also made Presents to the Sailors, some more, some less, and\\nlived a jovial Life all the while they were upon their Voyage, Captain\\n_Knot_ giving them their Way; nor indeed could he help himself, unless he\\nhad taken an Opportunity to surprize them, when they were either drunk or\\nasleep; for awake they wore Arms aboard the Ship, and put him in a\\ncontinual Terror; it not being his Principle (or the Sect's) to fight,\\nunless with Art and Collusion; he managed these Weapons well till he\\narrived at the Capes, and afterwards four of the Pyrates went off in a\\nBoat, which they had taken with them, for the more easily making their\\nEscapes, and made up the Bay towards _Maryland_, but were forced back by a\\nStorm into an obscure Place of the Country, where meeting with good\\nEntertainment among the Planters, they continued several Days without being\\ndiscovered to be Pyrates. In the mean Time Captain _Knot_ leaving four\\nothers on Board his Ship, (who intended to go to _North-Carolina_,) made\\nwhat hast he could to discover to Mr. _Spotswood_ the Governor, what sort\\nof Passengers he had been forced to bring with him, who by good Fortune got\\nthem seized; and Search being made after the others, who were revelling\\nabout the Country, they were also taken, and all try'd, convicted and\\nhang'd, two _Portuguese_ Jews who were taken on the Coast of _Brasil_, and\\nwhom they brought with them to _Virginia_, being the principal Evidences.\\nThe latter had found Means to lodge Part of their Wealth with the Planters,\\nwho never brought it to Account: But Captain _Knot_ surrendered up every\\nThing that belonged to them, that were taken aboard, even what they\\npresented to him, in lieu of such Things as they had plundered him of in\\ntheir Passage, and obliged his Men to do the like.\\n\\nSome Days after the taking of the _Virginia_ Man last mentioned, in\\ncruising in the Latitude of _Jamaica, Kennedy_ took a Sloop bound thither\\nfrom _Boston_, loaded with Bread and Flower; aboard of this Sloop went all\\nthe Hands who were for breaking the Gang, and left those behind that had a\\nMind to pursue further Adventures. Among the former were _Kennedy_, their\\nCaptain, of whose Honour they had such a dispicable Notion, that they were\\nabout to throw him over-board, when they found him in the Sloop, as fearing\\nhe might betray them all, at their return to _England_; he having in his\\nChildhood been bred a Pick-pocket, and before he became a Pyrate, a\\nHouse-breaker; both Professions that these Gentlemen have a very mean\\nOpinion of. However, Captain _Kennedy_, by taking solemn Oaths of Fidelity\\nto his Companions, was suffered to proceed with them.\\n\\nIn this Company there was but one that pretended to any skill in\\nNavigation, (for _Kennedy_ could neither write nor read, he being preferred\\nto the Command merely for his Courage, which indeed he had often\\nsignaliz'd, particularly in taking the _Portuguese_ Ship,) and he proved to\\nbe a Pretender only; for shaping their Course to _Ireland_, where they\\nagreed to land, they ran away to the North-West Coast of _Scotland_, and\\nthere were tost about by hard Storms of Wind for several Days, without\\nknowing where they were, and in great Danger of perishing: At length they\\npushed the Vessel into a little Creek, and went all ashore, leaving the\\nSloop at an Anchor for the next Comers.\\n\\nThe whole Company refresh'd themselves at a little Village about five Miles\\nfrom the Place where they left the Sloop, and passed there for Ship-wreck'd\\nSailors, and no doubt might have travelled on without Suspicion; but the\\nmad and riotous Manner of their Living on the Road, occasion'd their\\nJourney to be cut short, as we shall observe presently.\\n\\n_Kennedy_ and another left them here, and travelling to one of the\\nSea-Ports, ship'd themselves for _Ireland_, and arrived there in Safety.\\nSix or seven wisely withdrew from the rest, travelled at their leasure, and\\ngot to their much desired Port of _London_, without being disturbed or\\nsuspected; but the main Gang alarm'd the Country where-ever they came,\\ndrinking and roaring at such a Rate, that the People shut themselves up in\\ntheir Houses, in some Places, not daring to venture out among so many mad\\nFellows: In other Villages, they treated the whole Town, squandering their\\nMoney away, as if, like _Æsop_, they wanted to lighten their Burthens: This\\nexpensive manner of Living procured two of their drunken Straglers to be\\nknocked on the Head, they being found murdered in the Road, and their Money\\ntaken from them: All the rest, to the Number of seventeen as they drew nigh\\nto _Edinburgh_, were arrested and thrown into Goal, upon Suspicion, of they\\nknew not what; However, the Magistrates were not long at a Loss for proper\\nAccusations, for two of the Gang offering themselves for Evidences were\\naccepted of; and the others were brought to a speedy Tryal, whereof nine\\nwere convicted and executed.\\n\\n_Kennedy_ having spent all his Money, came over from _Ireland_, and kept a\\ncommon B--y-House on _Deptford_ Road, and now and then, 'twas thought, made\\nan Excursion abroad in the Way of his former Profession, till one of his\\nHoushold W--s gave Information against him for a Robbery, for which he was\\ncommitted to _Bridewell_; but because she would not do the Business by\\nhalves, she found out a Mate of a Ship that _Kennedy_ had committed Pyracy\\nupon, as he foolishly confess'd to her. This Mate, whose Name was _Grant_,\\npaid _Kennedy_ a Visit in _Bridewell_, and knowing him to be the Man,\\nprocured a Warrant, and had him committed to the _Marshalsea_ Prison.\\n\\nThe Game that _Kennedy_ had now to play was to turn Evidence himself;\\naccordingly he gave a List of eight or ten of his Comrades; but not being\\nacquainted with their Habitations, one only was taken, who, tho' condemn'd,\\nappeared to be a Man of a fair Character, was forc'd into their Service,\\nand took the first Opportunity to get from them, and therefore receiv'd a\\nPardon; but _Walter Kennedy_ being a notorious Offender, was executed the\\n19th of _July_, 1721, at _Execution Dock_.\\n\\nThe rest of the Pyrates who were left in the Ship _Rover_, staid not long\\nbehind, for they went ashore to one of the _West-India_ Islands; what\\nbecame of them afterwards, I can't tell, but the Ship was found at Sea by a\\nSloop belonging to St. _Christophers_, and carried into that Island with\\nonly nine Negroes aboard.\\n\\nThus we see what a disastrous Fate ever attends the Wicked, and how rarely\\nthey escape the Punishment due to their Crimes, who, abandon'd to such a\\nprofligate Life, rob, spoil, and prey upon Mankind, contrary to the Light\\nand Law of Nature, as well as the Law of God. It might have been hoped,\\nthat the Examples of these Deaths, would have been as Marks to the\\nRemainder of this Gang, how to shun the Rocks their Companions had split\\non; that they would have surrendered to Mercy, or divided themselves, for\\never from such Pursuits, as in the End they might be sure would subject\\nthem to the same Law and Punishment, which they must be conscious they now\\nequally deserved; _impending Law_, which never let them sleep well, unless\\nwhen drunk. But all the Use that was made of it here, was to commend the\\nJustice of the Court, that condemn'd _Kennedy, for he was a sad Dog_ (they\\nsaid) _and deserved the Fate he met with_.\\n\\nBut to go back to _Roberts_, whom we left on the Coast of _Caiana_, in a\\ngrievous Passion at what _Kennedy_ and the Crew had done; and who was now\\nprojecting new Adventures with his small Company in the Sloop; but finding\\nhitherto they had been but as a Rope of Sand, they formed a Set of\\nArticles, to be signed and sworn to, for the better Conservation of their\\nSociety, and doing Justice to one another; excluding all _Irish_ Men from\\nthe Benefit of it, to whom they had an implacable Aversion upon the Account\\nof _Kennedy_. How indeed _Roberts_ could think that an Oath would be\\nobligatory, where Defiance had been given to the Laws of God and Man, I\\ncan't tell, but he thought their greatest Security lay in this, _That it\\nwas every one's Interest to observe them if they were minded to keep up so\\nabominable a Combination_.\\n\\nThe following, is the Substance of the Articles, as taken from the\\nPyrates own Informations.\\n\\nI.\\n\\nE_Very Man has a Vote in Affairs of Moment; has equal Title to the\\nfresh Provisions, or strong Liquors, at any Time seized, and use them at\\npleasure, unless a Scarcity_ (no uncommon Thing among them) _make it\\nnecessary, for the good of all, to vote a Retrenchment_.\\n\\nII.\\n\\n_Every Man to be called fairly in turn, by List, on Board of Prizes,\\nbecause, (over and above their proper Share_,) _they were on these\\nOccasions allowed a Shift of Cloaths: But if they defrauded the Company to\\nthe Value of a Dollar, in Plate, Jewels, or Money_, MAROONING _was their\\nPunishment_. This was a Barbarous Custom of putting the Offender on Shore,\\non some desolate or uninhabited Cape or Island, with a Gun, a few Shot, a\\nBottle of Water, and a Bottle of Powder, to subsist with, or starve. _If\\nthe Robbery was only between one another, they contented themselves with\\nslitting the Ears and Nose of him that was Guilty, and set him on Shore,\\nnot in an uninhabited Place, but somewhere, where he was sure to encounter\\nHardships_.\\n\\nIII.\\n\\n_No Person to Game at Cards or Dice for Money_.\\n\\nIV.\\n\\n_The Lights and Candles to be put out at eight o'Clock at Night: If any of\\nthe Crew, after that Hour, still remained inclined for Drinking, they were\\nto do it on the open Deck_; which _Roberts_ believed would give a Check to\\ntheir Debauches, for he was a sober Man himself, but found at length, that\\nall his Endeavours to put an End to this Debauch, proved ineffectual.\\n\\nV.\\n\\n_To keep their Piece, Pistols, and Cutlash clean, and fit for Service_: In\\nthis they were extravagantly nice, endeavouring to outdo one another, in\\nthe Beauty and Richness of their Arms, giving sometimes at an Auction (at\\nthe Mast,) 30 or 40 _l._ a Pair, for Pistols. These were slung in Time of\\nService, with different coloured Ribbands, over their Shoulders, in a Way\\npeculiar to these Fellows, in which they took great Delight.\\n\\nVI.\\n\\n_No Boy or Woman to be allowed amongst them. If any Man were sound seducing\\nanny of the latter Sex, and carried her to Sea, disguised, he was to suffer\\nDeath_; so that when any fell into their Hands, as it chanced in the\\n_Onslow_, they put a Centinel immediately over her to prevent ill\\nConsequences from so dangerous an Instrument of Division and Quarrel; but\\nthen here lies the Roguery; they contend who shall be Centinel, which\\nhappens generally to one of the greatest Bullies, who, to secure the Lady's\\nVirtue, will let none lye with her but himself.\\n\\nVII.\\n\\n_To Desert the Ship, or their Quarters in Battle, was punished with Death,\\nor Marooning._\\n\\nVIII.\\n\\n_No striking one another on Board, but every Man's Quarrels to be ended on\\nShore, at Sword and Pistol, Thus_; The Quarter-Master of the Ship, when the\\nParties will not come to any Reconciliation, accompanies them on Shore with\\nwhat Assistance he thinks proper, and turns the Disputants Back to Back, at\\nso many Paces Distance: At the Word of Command, they turn and fire\\nimmediately, (or else the Piece is knocked out of their Hands:) If both\\nmiss, they come to their Cutlashes, and then he is declared Victor who\\ndraws the first Blood.\\n\\nIX.\\n\\n_No Man to talk of breaking up their Way of Living, till each had shared a_\\n1000 _l. If in order to this, any Man should lose a Limb, or become a\\nCripple in their Service, he was to have_ 800 _Dollars, out of the publick\\nStock, and for lesser Hurts, proportionably._\\n\\nX.\\n\\n_The Captain and Quarter-Master to receive two Shares of a Prize; the\\nMaster, Boatswain, and Gunner, one Share and a half, and other Officers,\\none and a Quarter._\\n\\nXI.\\n\\n_The Musicians to have Rest on the Sabbath Day, but the other six Days and\\nNights, none without special Favour._\\n\\nThese, we are assured, were some of _Roberts_'s Articles, but as they had\\ntaken Care to throw over-board the Original they had sign'd and sworn to,\\nthere is a great deal of Room to suspect, the remainder contained something\\ntoo horrid to be disclosed to any, except such as were willing to be\\nSharers in the Iniquity of them; let them be what they will, they were\\ntogether the Test of all new Comers, who were initiated by an Oath taken on\\na Bible, reserv'd for that Purpose only, and were subscrib'd to in Presence\\nof the worshipful Mr. _Roberts._ And in Case any Doubt should arise\\nconcerning the Construction of these Laws, and it should remain a Dispute\\nwhether the Party had infring'd them or no, a Jury is appointed to explain\\nthem, and bring in a Verdict upon the Case in Doubt.\\n\\nSince we are now speaking of the Laws of this Company, I shall go on, and,\\nin as brief a Manner as I can, relate the principal Customs, and\\nGovernment, of this roguish Common-Wealth; which are pretty near the same\\nwith all Pyrates.\\n\\nFor the Punishment of small Offences, which are not provided for by the\\nArticles, and which are not of Consequence enough to be left to a Jury,\\nthere is a principal Officer among the Pyrates, called the Quarter-Master,\\nof the Mens own chusing, who claims all Authority this Way, (excepting in\\nTime of Battle:) If they disobey his Command, are quarrelsome and mutinous\\nwith one another, misuse Prisoners, plunder beyond his Order, and in\\nparticular, if they be negligent of their Arms, which he musters at\\nDiscretion, he punishes at his own Arbitrement, with drubbing or whipping,\\nwhich no one else dare do without incurring the Lash from all the Ships\\nCompany: In short, this Officer is Trustee for the whole, is the first on\\nBoard any Prize, separating for the Company's Use, what he pleases, and\\nreturning what he thinks fit to the Owners, excepting Gold and Silver,\\nwhich they have voted not returnable.\\n\\nAfter a Description of the Quarter-Master, and his Duty, who acts as a sort\\nof a civil Magistrate on Board a Pyrate Ship; I shall consider their\\nmilitary Officer, the Captain; what Privileges he exerts in such anarchy\\nand unrulyness of the Members: Why truly very little, they only permit him\\nto be Captain, on Condition, that they may be Captain over him; they\\nseparate to his Use the great Cabin, and sometimes vote him small Parcels\\nof Plate and China, (for it may be noted that _Roberts_ drank his Tea\\nconstantly) but then every Man, as the Humour takes him, will use the Plate\\nand China, intrude into his Apartment, swear at him, seize a Part of his\\nVictuals and Drink, if they like it, without his offering to find Fault or\\ncontest it: Yet _Roberts_, by a better Management than usual, became the\\nchief Director in every Thing of Moment, and it happened thus:--The Rank of\\nCaptain being obtained by the Suffrage of the Majority, it falls on one\\nsuperior for Knowledge and Boldness, _Pistol Proof_ (as they call it,) and\\ncan make those fear, who do not love him; _Roberts_ is said to have\\nexceeded his Fellows in these Respects, and when advanced, enlarged the\\nRespect that followed it, by making a sort of Privy-Council of half a Dozen\\nof the greatest Bullies; such as were his Competitors, and had Interest\\nenough to make his Government easy; yet even those, in the latter Part of\\nhis Reign, he had run counter to in every Project that opposed his own\\nOpinion; for which, and because he grew reserved, and would not drink and\\nroar at their Rate, a Cabal was formed to take away his Captainship, which\\nDeath did more effectually.\\n\\nThe Captain's Power is uncontroulable in Chace, or in Battle, drubbing,\\ncutting, or even shooting any one who dares deny his Command. The same\\nPrivilege he takes over Prisoners, who receive good or ill Usage, mostly as\\nhe approves of their Behaviour, for tho' the meanest would take upon them\\nto misuse a Master of a Ship, yet he would controul herein, when he see it,\\nand merrily over a Bottle, give his Prisoners this double Reason for it.\\nFirst, That it preserved his Precedence; and secondly, That it took the\\nPunishment out of the Hands of a much more rash and mad Sett of Fellows\\nthan himself. When he found that Rigour was not expected from his People,\\n(for he often practised it to appease them,) then he would give Strangers\\nto understand, that it was pure Inclination that induced him to a good\\nTreatment of them, and not any Love or Partiality to their Persons; for,\\nsays he, _there is none of you but will hang me, I know, whenever you can\\nclinch me within your Power._\\n\\n                                * * *\\n\\nAnd now seeing the Disadvantages they were under for pursuing the Account,\\n_viz._ a small Vessel ill repaired, and without Provisions, or Stores; they\\nresolved one and all, with the little Supplies they could get, to proceed\\nfor the _West-Indies_, not doubting to find a Remedy for all these Evils,\\nand to retreive their Loss.\\n\\nIn the Latitude of _Deseada_, one of the Islands, they took two Sloops,\\nwhich supply'd them with Provisions and other Necessaries; and a few Days\\nafterwards, took a Brigantine belonging to _Rhode Island_, and then\\nproceeded to _Barbadoes_, off of which Island, they fell in with a\\n_Bristol_ Ship of 10 Guns, in her Voyage out, from whom they took abundance\\nof Cloaths, some Money, twenty five Bales of Goods, five Barrels of Powder,\\na Cable, Hawser, 10 Casks of Oatmeal, six Casks of Beef, and several other\\nGoods, besides five of their Men; and after they had detained her three\\nDays, let her go; who being bound for the abovesaid Island, she acquainted\\nthe Governor with what had happened, as soon as she arrived.\\n\\nWhereupon a _Bristol_ Galley that lay in the Harbour, was ordered to be\\nfitted out with all imaginable Expedition, of 20 Guns, and 80 Men, there\\nbeing then no Man of War upon that Station, and also a Sloop with 10 Guns,\\nand 40 Men: The Galley was commanded by one Captain _Rogers_, of _Bristol_,\\nand the Sloop by Captain _Graves_, of that Island, and Captain _Rogers_ by\\na Commission from the Governor, was appointed Commadore.\\n\\nThe second Day after _Rogers_ sailed out of the Harbour, he was discovered\\nby _Roberts_, who knowing nothing of their Design, gave them Chase: The\\n_Barbadoes_ Ships kept an easy sail till the Pyrates came up with them, and\\nthen _Roberts_ gave them a Gun, expecting they would have immediately\\nstruck to his pyratical Flag, but instead thereof, he was forced to receive\\nthe Fire of a Broadside, with three Huzzas at the same Time; so that an\\nEngagement ensued, but _Roberts_ being hardly put to it, was obliged to\\ncrowd all the Sail the Sloop would bear, to get off: The Galley sailing\\npretty well, kept Company for a long while, keeping a constant Fire, which\\ngail'd the Pyrate; however, at length by throwing over their Guns, and\\nother heavy Goods, and thereby light'ning the Vessel, they, with much ado,\\ngot clear; but _Roberts_ could never endure a _Barbadoes_ Man afterwards,\\nand when any Ships belonging to that Island fell in his Way, he was more\\nparticularly severe to them than others.\\n\\nCaptain _Roberts_ sailed in the Sloop to the Island of _Dominico_, where he\\nwatered, and got Provisions of the Inhabitants, to whom he gave Goods in\\nExchange. At this Place he met with 13 _Englishmen_, who had been set\\nashore by a _French Guard de la Coste_, belonging to _Martinico_, taken out\\nof two _New-England_ Ships, that had been seiz'd, as Prize, by the said\\n_French_ Sloop: The Men willingly entered with the Pyrates, and it proved a\\nseasonable Recruit.\\n\\nThey staid not long here, tho' they had immediate Occasion for cleaning\\ntheir Sloop, but did not think this a proper Place, and herein they judg'd\\nright; for the touching at this Island, had like to have been their\\nDestruction, because they having resolved to go away to the _Granada_\\nIslands, for the aforesaid Purpose, by some Accident it came to be known to\\nthe _French_ Colony, who sending Word to the Governor of _Martinico_, he\\nequipped and manned two Sloops to go in Quest of them. The Pyrates sailed\\ndirectly for the _Granadilloes_, and hall'd into a Lagoon, at _Corvocoo_,\\nwhere they cleaned with unusual Dispatch, staying but a little above a\\nWeek, by which Expedition they missed of the _Martinico_ Sloops, only a few\\nHours; _Roberts_ sailing over Night, that the _French_ arrived the next\\nMorning. This was a fortunate Escape, especially considering, that it was\\nnot from any Fears of their being discovered, that they made so much hast\\nfrom the Island; but, as they had the Impudence themselves to own, for the\\nwant of Wine and Women.\\n\\nThus narrowly escaped, they sailed for _Newfoundland_, and arrived upon the\\nBanks the latter end of _June_, 1720. They entered the Harbour of\\n_Trepassi_, with their black Colours flying, Drums beating, and Trumpets\\nsounding. There were two and twenty Vessels in the Harbour, which the Men\\nall quitted upon the Sight of the Pyrate, and fled ashore. It is impossible\\nparticularly to recount the Destruction and Havock they made here, burning\\nand sinking all the shipping, except a _Bristol_ Galley, and destroying the\\nFisheries, and Stages of the poor Planters, without Remorse or Compunction;\\nfor nothing is so deplorable as Power in mean and ignorant Hands, it makes\\nMen wanton and giddy, unconcerned at the Misfortunes they are imposing on\\ntheir Fellow Creatures, and keeps them smiling at the Mischiefs, that bring\\nthemselves no Advantage. _They are like mad Men, that cast Fire-Brands,\\nArrows, and Death, and say, are not we in Sport?_\\n\\n_Roberts_ mann'd the _Bristol_ Galley he took in the Harbour, and mounted\\n16 Guns on Board her, and cruising out upon the Banks, he met with nine or\\nten Sail of _French_ Ships, all which he destroyed except one of 26 Guns,\\nwhich they seiz'd, and carried off for their own Use. This Ship they\\nchrist'ned _the Fortune_, and leaving the _Bristol_ Galley to the _French_\\nMen, they sailed away in Company with the Sloop, on another Cruise, and\\ntook several Prizes, _viz._ the _Richard_ of _Biddiford, Jonathan\\nWhitfield_ Master; the _Willing Mind_ of _Pool_; the _Expectation_ of\\n_Topsham_; and the _Samuel_, Captain _Cary_, of _London_; out of these\\nShips they encreased their Company, by entring all the Men they could well\\nspare, in their own Service. The _Samuel_ was a rich Ship, and had several\\nPassengers on Board, who were used very roughly, in order to make them\\ndiscover their Money, threatning them every Moment with Death, if they did\\nnot resign every Thing up to them. They tore up the Hatches and entered the\\nHold like a parcel of Furies, and with Axes and Cutlashes, cut and broke\\nopen all the Bales, Cases, and Boxes, they could lay their Hands on; and\\nwhen any Goods came upon Deck, that they did not like to carry aboard,\\ninstead of tossing them into the Hold again, threw them over-board into the\\nSea; all this was done with incessant cursing and swearing, more like\\nFiends than Men. They carried with them, Sails, Guns, Powder, Cordage, and\\n8 or 9000 l. worth of the choicest Goods; and told Captain _Cary, That they\\nshould accept of no Act of Grace; that the K-- and P--t might be damned\\nwith their Acts of G-- for them; neither would they go to_ Hope-Point, _to\\nbe hang'd up a Sun drying, as_ Kidd_'s, and_ Braddish_'s Company were; but\\nthat if they should ever be overpower'd, they would set Fire to the Powder,\\nwith a Pistol, and go all merrily to Hell together._\\n\\nAfter they had brought all the Booty aboard, a Consultation was held\\nwhether they should sink or burn the Ship, but whilst they were debating\\nthe Matter, they spyed a Sail, and so left the _Samuel_, to give her Chace;\\nat Midnight they came up with the same, which proved to be a Snow from\\n_Bristol_, bound for _Boston_, Captain _Bowles_ Master: They us'd him\\nbarbarously, because of his Country, Captain _Rogers_, who attack'd them\\noff _Barbadoes_, being of the City of _Bristol._\\n\\n_July_ the 16th, which was two Days afterwards, they took a _Virginia_ Man\\ncalled the _Little York, James Philips_ Master, and the _Love_, of\\n_Leverpool_, which they plundered and let go; the next Day a Snow from\\n_Bristol_, call'd the _Phoenix, John Richards_ Master, met with the same\\nFate from them; as also a Brigantine, Captain _Thomas_, and a Sloop called\\nthe _Sadbury_; they took all the Men out of the Brigantine, and sunk the\\nVessel.\\n\\nWhen they left the Banks of _Newfoundland_, they sailed for the\\n_West-Indies_, and the Provisions growing short, they went for the Latitude\\nof the Island _Deseada_, to cruise, it being esteemed the likeliest Place\\nto meet with such Ships as (they used in their Mirth to say) were consigned\\nto them, with Supplies. And it has been very much suspected that Ships have\\nloaded with Provisions at the _English_ Colonies, on pretence of Trading on\\nthe Coast of _Africa_, when they have in reality been consigned to them;\\nand tho' a shew of Violence is offered to them when they meet, yet they are\\npretty sure of bringing their Cargo to a good Market.\\n\\nHowever, at this Time they missed with their usual Luck, and Provisions and\\nNecessaries becoming more scarce every Day, they retired towards St.\\n_Christophers_, where being deny'd all Succour or Assistance from the\\nGovernment, they fir'd in Revenge on the Town, and burnt two Ships in the\\nRoad, one of them commanded by Captain _Cox_, of _Bristol_; and then\\nretreated farther to the Island of St. _Bartholomew_, where they met with\\nmuch handsomer Treatment. The Governor not only supplying them with\\nRefreshments, but he and the Chiefs carressing them in the most friendly\\nManner: And the Women, from so good an Example, endeavoured to outvie each\\nother in Dress, and Behaviour, to attract the good Graces of such generous\\nLovers, that paid well for their Favours.\\n\\nSated at length with these Pleasures, and having taken on Board a good\\nsupply of fresh Provisions, they voted unanimously for the Coast of\\n_Guiney_, and in the Latitude of 22 N. in their Voyage thither, met with a\\n_French_ Ship from _Martinico_, richly laden, and, which was unlucky for\\nthe Master, had a property of being fitter for their Purpose, than the\\nBanker. _Exchange was no Robbery_ they said, and so after a little mock\\nComplaisance to _Monsieur_, for the Favour he had done them, they shifted\\ntheir Men, and took leave: This was their first _Royal Fortune._\\n\\nIn this Ship _Roberts_ proceeded on his designed Voyage; but before they\\nreached _Guiney_, he proposed to touch at _Brava_, the Southermost of\\n_Cape_ _Verd_ Islands and clean. But here again by an intolerable Stupidity\\nand want of Judgment, they got so far to Leeward of their Port, that\\ndespairing to regain it, or any of the Windward Parts of _Africa_, they\\nwere obliged to go back again with the Trade-Wind, for the _West-Indies_;\\nwhich had very near been the Destruction of them all. _Surinam_ was the\\nPlace now designed for, which was at no less than 700 Leagues Distance, and\\nthey had but one Hogshead of Water left to supply 124 Souls for that\\nPassage; a sad Circumstance that eminently exposes the Folly and Madness\\namong Pyrates, and he must be an inconsiderate Wretch indeed, who, if he\\ncould separate the Wickedness and Punishment from the Fact, would yet\\nhazard his Life amidst such Dangers, as their want of Skill and Forecast\\nmade them liable to.\\n\\nTheir Sins, we may presume were never so troublesome to their Memories, as\\nnow, that inevitable Destruction seem'd to threaten them, without the least\\nGlympse of Comfort or Alleviation to their Misery; for, with what Face\\ncould Wretches who had ravaged and made so many Necessitous, look up for\\nRelief; they had to that Moment lived in Defiance of the Power that now\\nalone they must trust for their Preservation, and indeed without the\\nmiraculous Intervention of Providence, there appeared only this miserable\\nChoice, viz. a present Death by their own Hands, or a ling'ring one by\\nFamine.\\n\\nThey continued their Course, and came to an Allowance of one single\\nMouthful of Water for 24 Hours; many of them drank their Urine, or Sea\\nWater, which, instead of allaying, gave them an inextinguishable Thirst,\\nthat killed them: Others pined and wasted a little more Time in Fluxes and\\nApyrexies, so that they dropped away daily. Those that sustain'd the Misery\\nbest, were such as almost starved themselves, forbearing all sorts of Food,\\nunless a Mouthful or two of Bread the whole Day, so that those who survived\\nwere as weak as it was possible for Men to be and alive.\\n\\nBut if the dismal Prospect they set out with, gave them Anxiety, Trouble,\\nor Pain, what must their Fears and Apprehensions be, when they had not one\\nDrop of Water left, or any other Liquor to moisten or animate. This was\\ntheir Case, when (by the working of Divine Providence, no doubt,) they were\\nbrought into Soundings, and at Night anchored in seven Fathom Water: This\\nwas an inexpressible Joy to them, and, as it were, fed the expiring Lamp of\\nLife with fresh Spirits; but this could not hold long. When the Morning\\ncame, they saw Land from the Mast-Head, but it was at so great a Distance,\\nthat it afforded but an indifferent Prospect to Men who had drank nothing\\nfor the two last Days; however, they dispatch'd their Boat away, and late\\nthe same Night it return'd, to their no small Comfort, with a load of\\nWater, informing them, that they had got off the Mouth of _Meriwinga_ River\\non the Coast of _Surinam._\\n\\nOne would have thought so miraculous an Escape should have wrought some\\nReformation, but alass, they had no sooner quenched their Thirst, but they\\nhad forgot the Miracle, till Scarcity of Provisions awakened their Senses,\\nand bid them guard against starving; their allowance was very small, and\\nyet they would profanely say, _That Providence which had gave them Drink,\\nwould, no doubt, bring them Meat also, if they would use but an honest\\nEndeavour._\\n\\nIn pursuance of these honest Endeavours, they were steering for the\\nLatitude of _Barbadoes_, with what little they had left, to look out for\\nmore, or Starve; and, in their Way, met a Ship that answered their\\nNecessities, and after that a Brigantine; the former was called the\\n_Greyhound_, belonging to St. _Christophers_, and bound to _Philadelphia_,\\nthe Mate of which signed the Pyrate's Articles, and was afterwards Captain\\nof the _Ranger_, Consort to the _Royal Fortune._\\n\\nOut of the Ship and Brigantine, the Pyrates got a good supply of Provisions\\nand Liquor, so that they gave over the designed Cruise, and watered at\\n_Tobago_, and hearing of the two Sloops that had been fitted out and sent\\nafter them at _Corvocoo_, they sailed to the Island of _Martinico_, to make\\nthe Governor some sort of an Equivalent, for the Care and Expedition he had\\nshewn in that Affair.\\n\\nIt is the Custom at _Martinico_, for the _Dutch_ Interlopers that have a\\nMind to Trade with the People of the Island, to hoist their Jacks when they\\ncome before the Town: _Roberts_ knew the Signal, and being an utter Enemy\\nto them, he bent his Thoughts upon Mischief; and accordingly came in with\\nhis Jack flying, which, as he expected, they mistook for a good Market, and\\nthought themselves happiest that could soonest dispatch off their Sloops\\nand Vessels for Trade. When _Roberts_ had got them within his Power, (one\\nafter another,) he told them, he would not have it said that they came off\\nfor nothing, and therefore ordered them to leave their Money behind, for\\nthat they were a Parcel of Rogues, and hoped they would always meet with\\nsuch a _Dutch_ Trade as this was; he reserved one Vessel to set the\\nPassengers on Shore again, and fired the rest, to the Number of twenty.\\n\\n_Roberts_ was so enraged at the Attempts that had been made for taking of\\nhim, by the Governors of _Barbados_ and _Martinico_, that he ordered a new\\nJack to be made, which they ever after hoisted, with his own Figure\\npourtray'd, standing upon two Skulls, and under them the Letters _A B H_\\nand _A M H_, signifying a _Barbadian_'s and a _Martinican_'s Head, as may\\nbe seen in the Plate of Captain _Roberts._\\n\\nAt _Dominico_, the next Island they touched at, they took a _Dutch_\\nInterloper of 22 Guns and 75 Men, and a Brigantine belonging to\\n_Rhode-Island_, one _Norton_ Master. The former made some Defence, till\\nsome of his Men being killed, the rest were discouraged and struck their\\nColours. With these two Prizes they went down to _Guadalupe_, and brought\\nout a Sloop, and a _French_ Fly-Boat laden with Sugar; the Sloop they\\nburnt, and went on to _Moonay_, another Island, thinking to clean, but\\nfinding the Sea ran too high there to undertake it with Safety, they bent\\ntheir Course for the North Part of _Hispaniola_, where, at Bennet's Key, in\\nthe Gulf of _Saminah_, they cleaned both the Ship and the Brigantine. For\\ntho' _Hispaniola_ be settled by the _Spaniards_ and _French_, and is the\\nResidence of a President from _Spain_, who receives, and finally determines\\nAppeals from all the other _Spanish West-India_ Islands; yet is its People\\nby no Means proportioned to its Magnitude, so that there are many Harbours\\nin it, to which Pyrates may securely resort without Fear of Discovery from\\nthe Inhabitants.\\n\\nWhilst they were here, two Sloops came in, as they pretended, to pay\\n_Roberts_ a Visit, the Masters, whose Names were _Porter_ and _Tuckerman_,\\naddressed the Pyrate, as the Queen of _Sheba_ did _Solomon_, to wit, _That\\nhaving heard of his Fame and Atchievements_, they had put in there to learn\\nhis Art and Wisdom in the Business of pyrating, being Vessels on the same\\nhonourable Design with himself; and hoped with the Communication of his\\nKnowledge, they should also receive his Charity, being in want of\\nNecessaries for such Adventures. _Roberts_ was won upon by the Peculiarity\\nand Bluntness of these two Men, and gave them Powder, Arms, and what ever\\nelse they had Occasion for, spent two or three merry Nights with them, and\\nat parting, said, _he hoped the L-- would Prosper their handy Works._\\n\\nThey passed some Time here, after they had got their Vessel ready, in their\\nusual Debaucheries; they had taken a considerable Quanty of Rum and Sugar,\\nso that Liquor was as plenty as Water, and few there were, who denied\\nthemselves the immoderate Use of it; nay, Sobriety brought a Man under a\\nSuspicion of being in a Plot against the Commonwealth, and in their Sense,\\nhe was looked upon to be a Villain that would not be drunk. This was\\nevident in the Affair of _Harry Glasby_, chosen Master of the _Royal\\nFortune_, who, with two others, laid hold of the Opportunity at the last\\nIsland they were at, to move off without bidding Farewel to his Friends.\\n_Glasby_ was a reserved sober Man, and therefore gave Occasion to be\\nsuspected, so that he was soon missed after he went away; and a Detachment\\nbeing sent in quest of the Deserters, they were all three brought back\\nagain the next Day. This was a capital Offence, and for which they were\\nordered to be brought to an immediate Tryal.\\n\\nHere was the Form of Justice kept up, which is as much as can be said of\\nseveral other Courts, that have more lawful Commissions for what they\\ndo.--Here was no feeing of Council, and bribing of Witnesses was a Custom\\nnot known among them; no packing of Juries, no torturing and wresting the\\nSense of the Law, for bye Ends and Purposes, no puzzling or perplexing the\\nCause with unintelligible canting Terms, and useless Distinctions; nor was\\ntheir Sessions burthened with numberless Officers, the Ministers of Rapine\\nand Extortion, with ill boding Aspects, enough to fright _Astræa_ from the\\nCourt. The Place appointed for their Tryals, was the Steerage of the Ship;\\nin order to which, a large Bowl of Rum Punch was made, and placed upon the\\nTable, the Pipes and Tobacco being ready, the judicial Proceedings began;\\nthe Prisoners were brought forth, and Articles of Indictment against them\\nread; they were arraigned upon a Statute of their own making, and the\\nLetter of the Law being strong against them, and the Fact plainly proved,\\nthey were about to pronounce Sentence, when one of the Judges mov'd, that\\nthey should first Smoak t'other Pipe; which was accordingly done.\\n\\nAll the Prisoners pleaded for Arrest of Judgment very movingly, but the\\nCourt had such an Abhorrence of their Crime, that they could not be\\nprevailed upon to shew Mercy, till one of the Judges, whose Name was\\n_Valentine Ashplant_, stood up, and taking his Pipe out of his Mouth, said,\\nhe had something to offer to the Court in behalf of one of the Prisoners;\\nand spoke to this Effect.-- _By G--_, Glasby _shall not dye; d--n me if he\\nshall._ After this learned Speech, he sat down in his Place, and resumed\\nhis Pipe. This Motion was loudly opposed by all the rest of the Judges, in\\nequivalent Terms; but _Ashplant_, who was resolute in his Opinion, made\\nanother pathetical Speech in the following Manner. _G-- d--n ye Gentlemen,\\nI am as good a Man as the best of you; d--m my_ S--l _if ever I turned my\\nBack to any Man in my Life, or ever will, by G_--; Glasby _is an honest\\nFellow, notwithstanding this Misfortune, and I love him, D--l d--n me if I\\ndon't: I hope he'll live and repent of what he has done; but d--n me if he\\nmust dye, I will dye along with him._ And thereupon, he pulled out a pair\\nof Pistols, and presented them to some of the learned Judges upon the\\nBench; who, perceiving his Argument so well supported, thought it\\nreasonable that _Glasby_ should be acquitted; and so they all came over to\\nhis Opinion, and allowed it to be Law.\\n\\nBut all the Mitigation that could be obtained for the other Prisoners, was,\\nthat they should have the Liberty of choosing any four of the whole Company\\nto be their Executioners. The poor Wretches were ty'd immediately to the\\nMast, and there shot dead, pursuant to their villainous Sentence.\\n\\nWhen they put to Sea again, the Prizes which had been detained only for\\nfear of spreading any Rumour concerning them, which had like to have been\\nso fatal at _Corvocoo_, were thus disposed of: They burnt their own Sloop,\\nand mann'd _Norton_'s Brigantine, sending the Master away in the _Dutch_\\nInterloper, not dissatisfied.\\n\\nWith the _Royal Fortune_, and the Brigantine, which they christened the\\n_Good Fortune_, they pushed towards the Latitude of _Deseada_, to look out\\nfor Provisions, being very short again, and just to their Wish, Captain\\n_Hingstone_'s ill Fortune brought him in their Way, richly laden for\\n_Jamaica_; him they carried to _Berbudas_ and plundered; and stretching\\nback again to the _West-Indies_, they continually met with some Consignment\\nor other, (chiefly _French,)_ which stored them with Plenty of Provisions,\\nand recruited their starving Condition; so that stocked with this sort of\\nAmmunition, they began to think of something worthier their Aim, for these\\nRobberies that only supplied what was in constant Expenditure, by no Means\\nanswered their Intentions; and accordingly they proceeded again for the\\nCoast of _Guiney_, where they thought to buy Gold-Dust very cheap. In their\\nPassage thither, they took Numbers of Ships of all Nations, some of which\\nthey burnt or sunk, as the Carriage or Characters of the Masters displeased\\nthem.\\n\\nNotwithstanding the successful Adventures of this Crew, yet it was with\\ngreat Difficulty they could be kept together, under any kind of Regulation;\\nfor being almost always mad or drunk, their Behaviour produced infinite\\nDisorders, every Man being in his own Imagination a Captain, a Prince, or a\\nKing. When _Roberts_ saw there was no managing of such a Company of wild\\nungovernable Brutes, by gentle means, nor to keep them from drinking to\\nexcess, the Cause of all their Disturbances, he put on a rougher\\nDeportment, and a more magesterial Carriage towards them, correcting whom\\nhe thought fit; and if any seemed to resent his Usage, he told them, _they\\nmight go ashore and take Satisfaction of him, if they thought fit, at Sword\\nand Pistol, for he neither valu'd or fear'd any of them._\\n\\nAbout 400 Leagues from the Coast of _Africa_, the Brigantine who had\\nhitherto lived with them, in all amicable Correspondence, thought fit to\\ntake the Opportunity of a dark Night, and leave the Commadore, which leads\\nme back to the Relation of an Accident that happened at one of the Islands\\nof the _West-Indies_, where they water'd before they undertook this Voyage,\\nwhich had like to have thrown their Government (such as it was) off the\\nHinges, and was partly the Occasion of the Separation: The Story is as\\nfollows.\\n\\nCaptain _Roberts_ having been insulted by one of the drunken Crew, (whose\\nName I have forgot,) he, in the Heat of his Passion killed the Fellow on\\nthe Spot, which was resented by a great many others, put particularly one\\n_Jones_, a brisk active young Man, who died lately in the _Marshalsea_, and\\nwas his Mess-Mate. This _Jones_ was at that Time ashore a watering the\\nShip, but as soon as he came on Board, was told that Captain _Roberts_ had\\nkilled his Comrade; upon which he cursed _Roberts_, and said, he ought to\\nbe served so himself. _Roberts_ hearing _Jones_'s Invective, ran to him\\nwith a Sword, and ran him into the Body; who, notwithstanding his Wound,\\nseized the Captain, threw him over a Gun, and beat him handsomely. This\\nAdventure put the whole Company in an Uproar, and some taking Part with the\\nCaptain, and others against him, there had like to have ensued a general\\nBattle with one another, like my Lord _Thomont_'s Cocks; however, the\\nTumult was at length appeas'd by the Mediation of the Quarter-Master; and\\nas the Majority of the Company were of Opinion that the Dignity of the\\nCaptain, ought to be supported on Board; that it was a Post of Honour, and\\ntherefore the Person whom they thought fit to confer it on, should not be\\nviolated by any single Member; wherefore they sentenced _Jones_ to undergo\\ntwo Lashes from every one of the Company, for his Misdemeanour, which was\\nexecuted upon him as soon as he was well of his Wound.\\n\\nThis severe Punishment did not at all convince _Jones_ that he was in the\\nwrong, but rather animated him to some sort of a Revenge; but not being\\nable to do it upon _Roberts_'s Person, on Board the Ship, he and several of\\nhis Comrades, correspond with _Anstis_, Captain of the Brigantine, and\\nconspire with him and some of the principal Pyrates on Board that Vessel,\\nto go off from the Company. What made _Anstis_ a Malecontent, was, the\\nInferiority he stood in, with Respect to _Roberts_, who carried himself\\nwith a haughty and magisterial Air, to him and his Crew, he regarding the\\nBrigantine only as a Tender, and, as such, left them no more than the\\nRefuse of their Plunder. In short, _Jones_ and his Consort go on Board of\\nCaptain _Anstis_, on Pretence of a Visit, and there consulting with their\\nBrethren, they find a Majority for leaving of _Roberts_, and so came to a\\nResolution to bid a soft Farewel, as they call it, that Night, and to throw\\nover-board whosoever should stick out; but they proved to be unanimous, and\\neffected their Design as above-mentioned.\\n\\nI shall have no more to say of Captain _Anstis_, till the Story of\\n_Roberts_ is concluded, therefore I return to him, in the pursuit of his\\nVoyage to _Guiney._ The loss of the Brigantine was a sensible Shock to the\\nCrew, she being an excellent Sailor, and had 70 Hands aboard; however,\\n_Roberts_ who was the Occasion of it, put on a Face of Unconcern at this\\nhis ill Conduct and Mismanagement, and resolved not to alter his Purposes\\nupon that Account.\\n\\n_Roberts_ fell in to Windward nigh the _Senegal_, a River of great Trade\\nfor Gum, on this Part of the Coast, monopolized by the _French_, who\\nconstantly keep Cruisers, to hinder the interloping Trade: At this Time\\nthey had two small Ships on that Service, one of 10 Guns and 65 Men, and\\nthe other of 16 Guns and 75 Men; who having got a Sight of Mr. _Roberts_,\\nand supposing him to be one of these prohibited Traders, chased with all\\nthe Sail they could make, to come up with him; but their Hopes which had\\nbrought them very nigh, too late deceived them, for on the hoisting of\\n_Jolly Roger_, (the Name they give their black Flag,) their _French_ Hearts\\nfailed, and they both surrendred without any, or at least very little\\nResistance. With these Prizes they went into _Sierraleon_, and made one of\\nthem their Consort, by the Name of the _Ranger_, and the other a\\nStore-Ship, to clean by.\\n\\n_Sierraleon_ River disgorges with a large Mouth, the Starboard-Side of\\nwhich, draughts into little Bays, safe and convenient for cleaning and\\nwatering; what still made it preferable to the Pyrates, is, that the\\nTraders settled here, are naturally their Friends. There are about 30\\n_English_ Men in all, Men who in some Part of their Lives, have been either\\nprivateering, buccaneering, or pyrating, and still retain and love the\\nRiots, and Humours, common to that sort of Life. They live very friendly\\nwith the Natives, and have many of them of both Sexes, to be their\\n_Grometta_'s, or Servants: The Men are faithful, and the Women so obedient,\\nthat they are very ready to prostitute themselves to whomsoever their\\nMasters shall command them. The Royal _African_ Company has a Fort on a\\nsmall Island call'd _Bence_ Island, but 'tis of little Use, besides keeping\\ntheir Slaves; the Distance making it incapable of giving any Molestation to\\ntheir Starboard Shore. Here lives at this Place an old Fellow, who goes by\\nthe Name of _Crackers_, who was formerly a noted Buccaneer, and while he\\nfollowed the Calling, robb'd and plundered many a Man; he keeps the best\\nHouse in the Place, has two or three Guns before his Door, with which he\\nSalutes his Friends, (the Pyrates, when they put in) and lives a jovial\\nLife with him, all the while they are there.\\n\\nHere follows a List, of the rest of those lawless Merchants, and their\\nServants, who carry on a private Trade with the Interlopers, to the great\\nPrejudice of the Royal _African_ Company, who with extraordinary Industry\\nand Expence, have made, and maintain, Settlements without any Consideration\\nfrom those, who, without such Settlements and Forts, would soon be under an\\nIncapacity of pursuing any such private Trade. Wherefore, 'tis to be hop'd,\\nproper Means will be taken, to root out a pernicious set of People, who\\nhave all their Lives, supported themselves by the Labours of other Men.\\n\\nTwo of these Fellows enter'd with _Robert_'s Crew, and continued with them,\\ntill the Destruction of the Company.\\n\\n_A List of the White-Men, now living on the high Land of_ Sierraleon,\\n_and the Craft they occupy._\\n\\nJ_OHN Leadstone_, three Boats and Periagoe.\\n\\nHis Man _Tom_,\\n\\nHis Man _John Brown._\\n\\n_Alexander Middleton_, one Long-Boat,\\n\\nHis Man _Charles Hawkins._\\n\\n_John Pierce_, Partners, one Long-Boat.\\n\\n_William Mead_, Partners, one Long-Boat.\\n\\nTheir Man _John Vernon._\\n\\n_David Chatmers_, one Long-Boat.\\n\\n_John Chatmers_, one Long-Boat.\\n\\n_Richard Richardson_, one Long-Boat.\\n\\n_Norton_, Partners, two Long-Boats, and two small Boats.\\n\\n_Richard Warren_, Partners, two Long-Boats, and two small Boats.\\n\\n_Roberts Glynn_, Partners, two Long-Boats, and two small Boats.\\n\\nHis Man _John Franks._\\n\\n_William Waits_, and one young Man.\\n\\n_John Bonnerman._\\n\\n_John England_, one Long-Boat.\\n\\n_Robert Samples_, one Long-Boat.\\n\\n_William Presgrove_, one Sloop, two Long-Boats, a small Boat, and Periagoe.\\n\\n_Harry_, one Sloop, two Long-Boats, a small Boat, and Periagoe.\\n\\n_Davis_, one Sloop, two Long-Boats, a small Boat, and Periagoe.\\n\\n_Mitchel_, one Sloop, two Long-Boats, a small Boat, and Periagoe.\\n\\n_Richard Lamb_,\\n\\nWith _Roquis Rodrigus_, a _Portuguese._\\n\\n_George Bishop._\\n\\n_Peter Brown._\\n\\n_John Jones_, one Long-Boat,\\n\\nHis _Irish_ young Man.\\n\\nAt _Rio Pungo, Benjamen Gun._\\n\\nAt _Kidham, George Yeats._\\n\\nAt _Gallyneas, Richard Lemmons._\\n\\n                                * * *\\n\\nThe Harbour is so convenient for Wooding and Watering, that it occasions\\nmany of our trading Ships, especially those of _Bristol_, to call in there,\\nwith large Cargoes of Beer, Syder, and strong Liquors, which they Exchange\\nwith these private Traders, for Slaves and Teeth, purchased by them at the\\n_Rio Nune_'s, and other Places to the Northward, so that here was what they\\ncall good Living.\\n\\nHither _Roberts_ came the End of _June_, 1721, and had Intelligence that\\nthe _Swallow_, and _Weymouth_, two Men of War, of 50 Guns each, had left\\nthat River about a Month before, and designed to return about _Christmas_;\\nso that the Pyrates could indulge themselves with all the Satisfaction in\\nthe World, in that they knew they were not only secure whilst there, but\\nthat in going down the Coast, after the Men of War, they should always be\\nable to get such Intelligence of their Rendezvous, as would serve to make\\ntheir Expedition safe. So after six Weeks stay, the Ships being cleaned and\\nfitted, and the Men weary of whoring and drinking, they bethought\\nthemselves of Business, and went to Sea the Beginning of _August_, taking\\ntheir Progress down the whole Coast, as low as _Jaquin_, plundering every\\nShip they met, of what was valuable in her, and sometimes to be more\\nmischieviously wicked, would throw what they did not want, overboard,\\naccumulating Cruelty to Theft.\\n\\nIn this Range, they exchanged their old _French_ Ship, for a fine Frigate\\nbuilt Ship, call'd the _Onslow_, belonging to the Royal _African_ Company,\\nCaptain _Gee_ Commander, which happened to lye at _Sestos_, to get Water\\nand Necessaries for the Company. A great many of Captain _Gee_'s Men were\\nashore, when _Robert_'s bore down, and so the Ship consequently surpriz'd\\ninto his Hands, tho' had they been all on Board, it was not likely the Case\\nwould have been otherwise, the Sailors, most of them, voluntarily joyning\\nthe Pyrates, and encouraging the same Disposition in the Soldiers, (who\\nwere going Passengers with them to _Cape-Corso-Castle_) whose Ears being\\nconstantly tickled with the Feats and Gallantry of those Fellows, made them\\nfancy, that _to go_, was only being bound on a Voyage of Knight Errantry\\n(to relieve the Distress'd, and gather up Fame) and so they likewise\\noffer'd themselves; but here the Pyrates were at a Stand, they entertain'd\\nso contemptible a Notion of Landmen, that they put 'em off with Refusals\\nfor some time, till at length, being weary'd with Solicitations, and\\npittying a Parcel of stout Fellows, which they said, were going to starve\\nupon a little Canky and Plantane, they accepted of them, and allow'd them ¼\\nShare, as it was then term'd out of Charity.\\n\\nThere was a Clergyman on Board the _Onslow_, sent from _England_, to be\\nChaplain of _Cape-Corso-Castle_, some of the Pyrates were for keeping him,\\nalledging merrily, that their Ship wanted a Chaplain; accordingly they\\noffered him a Share, to take on with them, promising, he should do nothing\\nfor his Money, but make Punch, and say Prayers; yet, however brutish they\\nmight be in other Things, they bore so great a Respect to his Order, that\\nthey resolved not to force him against his Inclinations; and the Parson\\nhaving no Relish for this sort of Life, excused himself from accepting the\\nHonour they designed him; they were satisfied, and generous enough to\\ndeliver him back every Thing he owned to be his: The Parson laid hold of\\nthis favourable Disposition of the Pyrates, and laid Claim to several\\nThings belonging to others, which were also given up, to his great\\nSatisfaction; in fine, they kept nothing which belonged to the Church,\\nexcept three Prayer-Books, and a Bottle-Screw.\\n\\nThe Pyrates kept the _Onslow_ for their own Use, and gave Captain _Gee_ the\\n_French_ Ship, and then fell to making such Alterations as might fit her\\nfor a Sea-Rover, pulling down her Bulk-Heads, and making her flush, so that\\nshe became, in all Respects, as compleat a Ship for their Purpose, as any\\nthey could have found; they continued to her the Name of the _Royal\\nFortune_, and mounted her with 40 Guns.\\n\\nShe and the _Ranger_ proceeded (as I said before,) to _Jaquin_, and from\\nthence to _Old Calabar_, where they arrived about _October_, in order to\\nclean their Ships, a Place the most suitable along the whole Coast, for\\nthere is a Bar with not above 15 Foot Water upon it, and the Channel\\nintricate, so that had the Men of War been sure of their being harbour'd\\nhere, they might still have bid Defiance to their Strength, for the Depth\\nof Water at the Bar, as well as the want of a Pilot, was a sufficient\\nSecurity to the Rovers, and invincible Impediments to them. Here therefore\\nthey sat easy, and divided the Fruits of their dishonest Instustry, _and\\ndrank and drove Care away._ The Pilot who brought them into this Harbour,\\nwas Captain _L--e_, who for this, and other Services, was extreamly well\\npaid, according to the Journal of their own Accounts, which do not run in\\nthe ordinary and common way, of _Debtor, contra Creditor_, but much more\\nconcise, lumping it to their Friends, and so carrying the Debt in their\\nHeads, against the next honest Trader they meet. They took at _Calabar_,\\nCaptain _Loane_, and two or three _Bristol_ Ships, the Particulars of all\\nwhich would be an unnecessary Prolixity, therefore I come now to give an\\nAccount of the Usage they received from the Natives of this Place. The\\n_Calabar_ Negroes did not prove so civil as they expected, for they refused\\nto have any Commerce or Trade with them, when they understood they were\\nPyrates: An Indication that these poor Creatures, in the narrow\\nCircumstances they were in, and without the Light of the Gospel, or the\\nAdvantage of an Education, have, notwithstanding, such a moral innate\\nHonesty, as would upbraid and shame the most knowing Christian: But this\\ndid but exasperate these lawless Fellows, and so a Party of 40 Men were\\ndetach'd to force a Correspondence, or drive the Negroes to Extremities;\\nand they accordingly landed under the Fire of their own Cannon. The Negroes\\ndrew up in a Body of 2000 Men, as if they intended to dispute the Matter\\nwith them, and staid till the Pyrates advanced within Pistol-shot; but\\nfinding the Loss of two or three, made no Impression on the rest, the\\nNegroes thought fit to retreat, which they did, with some Loss: The Pyrates\\nset Fire to the Town, and then return'd to their Ships. This terrified the\\nNatives, and put an entire stop to all the Intercourse between them; so\\nthat they could get no Supplies, which obliged them, as soon as they had\\nfinished the cleaning and triming of their Ships, to lose no Time, but went\\nfor Cape _Lopez_, and watered, and at _Anna-Bona_ took aboard a Stock of\\nfresh Provisions, and then sailed for the Coast again.\\n\\nThis was their last and fatal Expedition, which we shall be more particular\\nin, because, it cannot be imagined that they could have had Assurance to\\nhave undertaken it, but upon a Presumption, that the Men of War, (whom they\\nknew were upon the Coast,) were unable to attack them, or else pursuant to\\nthe Rumour that had indiscretionally obtained at _Sierraleon_, were gone\\nthither again.\\n\\nIt is impossible at this Time, to think they could know of the weak and\\nsickly Condition they were in, and therefore founded the Success of this\\nsecond Attempt upon the Coast, on the latter Presumption, and this seems to\\nbe confirmed by their falling in with the Coast as low as Cape _Lahou_,\\n(and even that was higher than they designed,) in the beginning of\\n_January_, and took the Ship called the _King Solomon_, with 20 Men in\\ntheir Boat, and a trading Vessel, both belonging to the Company. The Pyrate\\nShip happened to fall about a League to Leeward of the _King Solomon_, at\\nCape _Appollonia_, and the Current and Wind opposing their working up with\\nthe Ship, they agreed to send the Long-Boat, with a sufficient Number of\\nMen to take her: The Pyrates are all Voluntiers on these Occasions, the\\nWord being always given, _who will go?_ And presently the stanch and firm\\nMen offer themselves; because, by such Readiness, they recommend their\\nCourage, and have an Allowance also of a Shift of Cloaths, from Head to\\nFoot, out of the Prize.\\n\\nThey rowed towards the _King Solomon_ with a great deal of Alacrity, and\\nbeing hailed by the Commander of her, answered, _Defiance_; Captain\\n_Trahern_, before this, observing a great Number of Men in the Boat, began\\nnot to like his Visitors, and prepared to receive them, firing a Musket as\\nthey come under his Stern, which they returned with a Volley, and made\\ngreater Speed to get on Board: Upon this, he applied to his Men, and ask'd\\nthem, whether they would stand by him, to defend the Ship, it being a Shame\\nthey should be taken by half their Number, without any Repulse? But his\\nBoatswain, _Philips_, took upon him to be the Mouth of the People, and put\\nan End to the Dispute; he said plainly, he would not, laid down his Arms in\\nthe King's Name, as he was pleased to term it, and called out to the Boat\\nfor Quarters, so that the rest, by his Example, were mislead to the losing\\nof the Ship.\\n\\nWhen they came on Board, they brought her under Sail, by an expeditious\\nMethod, of cutting the Cable; _Walden_, one of the Pyrates, telling the\\nMaster, this _yo hope_ of heaving up the Anchor was a needless trouble,\\nwhen they designed to burn the Ship. They brought her under Commadore\\n_Roberts_'s Stern, and not only rifled her of what Sails, Cordage, _&c._\\nthey wanted for themselves, but wantonly throw'd the Goods of the Company\\noverboard, like Spend-thrifts, that neither expected or designed any\\nAccount.\\n\\nOn the same Day also, they took the _Flushing_, a _Dutch_ Ship, robbed her\\nof Masts, Yards and Stores, and then cut down her Fore-Mast; but what sat\\nas heavily as any thing with the _Skipper_, was, their taking some fine\\nSausages he had on Board, of his Wife's making, and stringing them in a\\nludicrous Manner, round their Necks, till they had sufficiently shew'd\\ntheir Contempt of them, and then threw them into the Sea. Others chopp'd\\nthe Heads of his Fowls off, to be dressed for their Supper, and courteously\\ninvited the Landlord, provided he would find Liquor. It was a melancholly\\nRequest to the Man, but it must be comply'd with, and he was obliged, as\\nthey grew drunk, to sit quietly, and hear them sing _French_ and _Spanish_\\nSongs out of his _Dutch_ Prayer-Books, with other Prophaness, that he (tho'\\na _Dutch_ Man) stood amazed at.\\n\\nIn chasing too near in, they alarmed the Coast, and Expresses were sent to\\nthe _English_ and _Dutch_ Factories, giving an Account of it: They were\\nsensible of this Error immediately, and because they would make the best of\\na bad Market, resolved to keep out of sight of Land, and lose the Prizes\\nthey might expect between that and _Whydah_, to make the more sure of that\\nPort, where commonly is the best Booty; all Nations trading thither,\\nespecially _Portuguese_, who purchase chiefly with Gold, the Idol their\\nHearts were bent upon. And notwithstanding this unlikely Course, they met\\nand took several Ships between _Axim_ and that Place; the circumstantial\\nStories of which, and the pannick Terrors they struck into his Majesty's\\nSubjects, being tedious and unnecessary to relate, I shall pass by, and\\ncome to their Arrival in that Road.\\n\\nThey came to _Whydah_ with a St. _George_'s Ensign, a black Silk Flag\\nflying at their Mizen-Peek, and a Jack and Pendant of the same: The Flag\\nhad a Death in it, with an Hour-Glass in one Hand, and cross Bones in the\\nother, a Dart by it, and underneath a Heart dropping three Drops of\\nBlood.--The Jack had a Man pourtray'd in it, with a flaming Sword in his\\nHand, and standing on two Skulls, subscribed _A B H_ and _A M H i. e._ a\\n_Barbadian_'s and a _Martinican_'s Head, as has been before taken Notice\\nof. Here they found eleven Sail in the Road, _English, French_ and\\n_Portuguese_; the _French_ were three stout Ships of 30 Guns, and upwards\\nof 100 Men each, yet when _Roberts_ came to Fire, they, with the other\\nShips, immediately struck their Colours and surrendred to his Mercy. One\\nReason, it must be confess'd, of his easy Victory, was, the Commanders and\\na good Part of the Men being ashore, according to the Custom of the Place,\\nto receive the Cargoes, and return the Slaves, they being obliged to watch\\nthe Seasons for it, which otherwise, in so dangerous a Sea as here, would\\nbe impracticable. These all, except the _Porcupine_, ransomed with him for\\neight Pound of Gold-Dust, a Ship, not without the trouble of some Letters\\npassing and repassing from the Shore, before they could settle it; and\\nnotwithstanding the Agreement and Payment, they took away one of the\\n_French_ Ships, tho' with a Promise to return her, if they found she did\\nnot sail well, taking with them several of her Men for that End.\\n\\nSome of the Foreigners, who never had Dealing this Way before, desired for\\nSatisfaction to their Owners, that they might have Receipts for their\\nMoney, which were accordingly given, a Copy of one of them, I have here\\nsubjoined, _viz._\\n\\n                                * * *\\n\\nT_HIS is to certify whom it may or doth concern, that we_ GENTLEMEN\\nOF FORTUNE, _have received eight Pounds of Gold-Dust, for the Ransom of\\nthe_ Hardey, _Captain_ Dittwitt _Commander, so that we Discharge the said\\nShip_,\\n\\n_Witness our Hands, this_ 13_th of_ Jan. 1721-2.\\n\\nBatt. Roberts, Harry Glasby.\\n\\nOthers were given to the _Portuguese_ Captains, which were in the same\\nForm, but being sign'd by two waggish Fellows, _viz. Sutton_, and\\n_Sympson_, they subscribed by the Names of,\\n\\n_Aaron Whifflingpin_, _Sim. Tugmutton._\\n\\nBut there was something so singularly cruel and barbarous done here to the\\n_Porcupine_, Captain _Fletcher_, as must not be passed over without special\\nRemark.\\n\\nThis Ship lay in the Road, almost slaved, when the Pyrates came in, and the\\nCommander being on Shore, settling his Accounts, was sent to for the\\nRansom, but he excused it, as having no Orders from the Owners; though the\\ntrue Reason might be, that he thought it dishonourable to treat with\\nRobbers; and that the Ship, separate from the Slaves, towards whom he could\\nmistrust no Cruelty, was not worth the Sum demanded; hereupon, _Roberts_\\nsends the Boat to transport the Negroes, in order to set her on Fire; but\\nbeing in hast, and finding that unshackling them cost much Time and Labour,\\nthey actually set her on Fire, with eighty of those poor Wretches on Board,\\nchained two and two together, under the miserable Choice of perishing by\\nFire or Water: Those who jumped overboard from the Flames, were seized by\\nSharks, a voracious Fish, in Plenty in this Road, and, in their Sight, tore\\nLimb from Limb alive. A Cruelty unparalell'd! And for which had every\\nIndividual been hanged, few I imagine would think that Justice had been\\nrigorous.\\n\\nThe Pyrates, indeed, were obliged to dispatch their Business here in hast,\\nbecause they had intercepted a Letter from General _Phips_ to Mr.\\n_Baldwin_, the Royal _African_ Company's Agent at _Whydah_, (giving an\\nAccount, that _Roberts_ had been seen to Windward of Cape _Three Points_,)\\nthat he might the better guard against the Damages to the Company's Ships,\\nif he should arrive at that Road before the _Swallow_ Man of War, which he\\nassured him, (at the Time of that Letter,) was pursuing them to that Place.\\n_Roberts_ call'd up his Company, and desired they would hear _Phip_'s\\nSpeech, (for so he was pleased to call the Letter,) and notwithstanding\\ntheir vapouring, perswaded them of the Necessity of moving; for, says he,\\nsuch brave Fellows cannot be supposed to be frightned at this News, yet\\nthat it were better to avoid dry Blows, which is the best that can be\\nexpected, if overtaken.\\n\\nThis Advice weigh'd with them, and they got under Sail, having stay'd only\\nfrom _Thursday_ to _Saturday_ Night, and at Sea voted for the Island of\\n_Anna Bona_; but the Winds hanging out of the Way, crossed their Purpose,\\nand brought them to Cape _Lopez_, where I shall leave them for their\\napproaching Fate, and relate some further Particulars of his Majesty's Ship\\nthe _Swallow, viz._ where it was she had spent her Time, during the\\nMischief that was done, and by what Means unable to prevent it; what also\\nwas the Intelligence she received, and the Measures thereon formed, that at\\nlast brought two such Strangers as Mr _Roberts_ and Capt. _Ogle_, to meet\\nin so remote a Corner of the World.\\n\\nThe _Swallow_ and _Weymouth_ left _Sierraleon, May_ 28, where, I have\\nalready taken Notice, _Roberts_ arrived about a Month after, and doubtless\\nlearn'd the Intent of their Voyage, and cleaning on the Coast; which made\\nhim set down with more Security to his Diversion, and furnish him with such\\nIntimations, as made his first Range down the Coast in _August_ following,\\nmore prosperous; the _Swallow_ and _Weymouth_ being then at the Port of\\n_Princes_ a cleaning.\\n\\nTheir Stay at _Princes_ was from _July_ 28 to _Sept._ 20, 1721, where, by a\\nFatality, common to the Irregularities of Seamen, (who cannot in such Cases\\nbe kept under due Restraints,) they buried 100 Men in three Weeks time, and\\nreduced the Remainder of the Ships Companies into so sickly a State, that\\nit was with Difficulty they brought them to sail; and this Misfortune was\\nprobably the Ruin of _Roberts_, for it prevented the Men of War's going\\nback to _Sierraleon_, as it was intended, there being a Necessity of\\nleaving his Majesty's Ship _Weymouth_ (in much the worse Condition of the\\ntwo) under the Guns of Cape _Corso_, to impress Men, being unable at this\\nTime, either to hand the Sails, or weigh her Anchor; and _Roberts_ being\\nignorant of the Occasion or Alteration of the first Design, fell into the\\nMouth of Danger, when he thought himself the farthest from it; for the Men\\nof War not endeavouring to attain further to Windward (when they came from\\n_Princes_) then to secure Cape _Corso_ Road under their Lee, they luckily\\nhovered in the Track he had took.\\n\\nThe _Swallow_ and _Weymouth_ fell in with the Continent at Cape\\n_Appollonia, Octo._ 20th, and there received the ungrateful News from one\\nCaptain _Bird_; a Notice that awaken'd and put them on their Guard; but\\nthey were far from expecting any Temerity should ever bring him a second\\nTime on the Coast, while they were there; therefore the _Swallow_ having\\nseen the _Weymouth_ into Cape _Corso_ Road _Nov._ 10th, she ply'd to\\nWindward as far as _Bassam_, rather as an Airing to recover a sickly Ship's\\nCompany, and shew herself to the Trade, which was found every where\\nundisturb'd, and were, for that Reason, returning to her Consort, when\\naccidently meeting a _Portuguese_ Ship, she told her, that the Day before\\nshe saw two Ships Chace into _Junk_, an _English_ Vessel, which she\\nbelieved must have fallen into their Hands. On this Story, the _Swallow_\\nclung her Wind, and endeavoured to gain that Place, but receiving soon\\nafter (_Octo._ the 14th) a contrary Report from Captain _Plummer_, an\\nintelligent Man, in the _Jason_ of _Bristol_, who had come further to\\nWindward, and neither saw or heard any Thing of this; she turned her Head\\ndown the second Time, anchored at Cape _Appollonia_ the 23d, at Cape _Tres\\nPuntas_ the 27th, and in _Corso_ Road _January_ the 7th, 1721-2.\\n\\nThey learned that their Consort the _Weymouth_, was, by the Assistance of\\nsome Soldiers from the Castle, gone to Windward, to demand Restitution of\\nsome Goods or Men belonging to the _African_ Company, that were illegally\\ndetained by the _Dutch_ at _Des Minas_; and while they were regretting so\\nlong a Separation, an Express came to General _Phips_, from _Axim_, the\\n9th, and followed by another from _Dixcove_, (an _English_ Factory,) with\\nInformation that three Ships had chased and taken a Galley nigh _Axim_\\nCastle, and a trading Boat belonging to the Company: No doubt was made,\\nconcerning what they were, it being taken for granted they were Pyrates,\\nand supposed to be the same that had the _August_ before infested the\\nCoast. The natural Result therefore, from these two Advices, was, to hasten\\nfor _Whydah_; for it was conclued the Prizes they had taken, had informed\\nthem how nigh the _Swallow_ was, and withal, how much better in Health than\\nshe had been for some Months past; so that unless they were very mad\\nindeed, they would (after being discovered) make the best of their Way for\\n_Whydah_, and secure the Booty there, without which, their Time and\\nIndustry had been entirely lost; most of the Gold lying in that Corner.\\n\\nThe _Swallow_ weighed from _Cape-Corso, January_ the 10th, but was retarded\\nby waiting some Hours on the _Margaret_, a Company's Ship, at _Accra_,\\nagain on the _Portugal_, and a whole Day at _Apong_, on a Person they used\\nto stile _Miss Betty_: A Conduct that Mr. _Phips_ blamed, when he heard the\\nPyrates were miss'd at _Whydah_, altho' he had given it as his Opinion,\\nthey could not be passed by, and intimated, that to stay a few Hours would\\nprove no Prejudice.\\n\\nThis, however, hinder'd the _Swallow_'s catching them at _Whydah_, for the\\nPyrates came into that Road, with a fresh Gale of Wind, the same Day the\\n_Swallow_ was at _Apong_, and sail'd the 13th of _January_ from thence,\\nthat she arrived the 17th. She gained Notice of them by a _French_ Shallop\\nfrom _Grand Papa_, the 14th at Night, and from _Little Papa_ next Morning\\nby a _Dutch_ Ship; so that the Man of War was on all Sides, as she thought,\\nsure of her Purchase, particularly when she made the Ships, and discovered\\nthree of them to get under Sail immediately at Sight of her, making Signals\\nto one another, as tho' they designed a Defence; but they were found to be\\nthree _French_ Ships; and those at Anchor, _Portuguese_ and _English_, all\\nhonest Traders, who had been ransack'd and ransom'd.\\n\\nThis Disappointment chagreen'd the Ship's Company, who were very intent\\nupon their Market; which was reported to be an Arm-Chest full of Gold, and\\nkept with three Keys; tho' in all liklyhood, had they met with them in that\\nopen Road, one or both would have made their Escapes; or if they had\\nthought sit to have fought, an Emulation in their Defence would probably\\nhave made it desperate.\\n\\nWhile they were contemplating on the Matter, a Letter was received from Mr.\\n_Baldwin_, (Governor here for the Company,) signifying, that the Pyrates\\nwere at _Jaquin_, seven Leagues lower. The _Swallow_ weighed at two next\\nMorning, _January_ the 16th, and got to _Jaquin_ by Day-Light, but to no\\nother End, than frightening the Crews of two _Portuguese_ Ships on Shore,\\nwho took her for the Pyrate that had struck such Terror at _Whydah_: She\\nreturned therefore that Night, and having been strengthened with thirty\\nVoluntiers, _English_ and _French_, the discarded Crews of the _Porcupine_,\\nand the _French_ Ship they had carried from hence, she put to Sea again\\n_January_ the 19th, conjecturing, that either _Calabar, Princes_, the River\\n_Gabone_, Cape _Lopez_, or _Annabona_, must be touched at for Water and\\nRefreshment, tho' they should resolve to leave the Coast. As to the former\\nof those Places, I have before observed, it was hazardous to think of, or\\nrather impracticable; _Princes_ had been a sower Grape to them, but being\\nthe first in the Way, she came before the Harbour the 29th, where learning\\nno News, without loosing Time, steered for the River _Gabone_, and anchored\\nat the Mouth of it _February_ the 1st.\\n\\nThis River is navigable by two Channels, and has an Island about five\\nLeagues up, called _Popaguays_ or _Parrots_, where the _Dutch_ Cruisers,\\nfor this Coast, generally Clean, and where sometimes Pyrates come in to\\nlook for Prey, or to Refit, it being very convenient, by Reason of a soft\\nMud about it, that admits a Ship's lying on Shore, with all her Guns and\\nStores in, without Damage. Hither Captain _Ogle_ sent his Boat and a\\nLieutenant, who spoke with a _Dutch_ Ship, above the Island, from whom he\\nhad this Account, _viz._ That he had been four Days from Cape _Lopez_, and\\nhad left no Ship there. However, they beat up for the Cape, without regard\\nto this Story, and on the 5th, at Dawning, was surprized with the Noise of\\na Gun, which, as the Day brightened, they found was from Cape _Lopez_ Bay,\\nwhere they discovered three Ships at Anchor, the largest with the King's\\nColours and Pendant flying, which was soon after concluded to be Mr.\\n_Roberts_ and his Consorts; but the _Swallow_ being to Windward, and\\nunexpectedly deep in the Bay, was obliged to Steer off, for avoiding a\\nSand, called the _French Man_'s _Bank_, which the Pyrates observed for some\\nTime, and rashly interpreting it to be Fear in her, righted the _French\\nRanger_, which was then on the Heel, and ordered her to chase out in all\\nhast, bending several of their Sails in the Pursuit. The Man of War finding\\nthey had foolishly mistaken her Design, humoured the Deceit, and kept off\\nto Sea, as if she had been really afraid, and managed her Steerage so,\\nunder the Direction of Lieutenant _Sun_, an experienced Officer, as to let\\nthe _Ranger_ come up with her, when they thought they had got so far as not\\nto have their Guns heard by her Consort at the Cape. The Pyrates had such\\nan Opinion of their own Courage, that they could never dream any Body would\\nuse a Stratagem to speak with them, and so was the more easily drawn into\\nthe Snare.\\n\\nThe Pyrates now drew nigh enough to fire their Chase Guns; they hoisted the\\nblack Flag that was worn in _Whydah_ Road, and got their Spritsail Yard\\nalong-ships, with Intent to board; no one having ever asked, all this\\nwhile, what Country Ship they took the Chase to be; they would have her to\\nbe a _Portuguese_, (Sugar being then a Commodity among them,) and were\\nswearing every Minute at the Wind or Sails to expedite so sweet a Chase;\\nbut, alass, all turned sour in an Instant: It was with the utmost\\nConsternation they saw her suddenly bring to, and hawl up her lower Ports,\\nnow within Pistol-shot, and struck their black Flag upon it directly. After\\nthe first Surprize was over, they kept firing at a Distance, hoisted it\\nagain, and vapoured with their Cutlashes on the Poop; tho' wisely\\nendeavouring at the same Time to get away. Being now at their Wits end,\\nboarding was proposed by the Heads of them, and so to make one desperate\\nPush; but the Motion not being well seconded, and their Main-Top-Mast\\ncoming down by a Shot, after two Hours firing, it was declin'd; they grew\\nSick, struck their Colours, and called out for Quarters; having had 10 Men\\nkilled out right, and 20 wounded, without the loss or hurt of one of the\\nKing's Men. She had 32 Guns, mann'd with 16 _French_ Men, 20 Negroes, and\\n77 _English._ The Colours were thrown over board, that they might not rise\\nin Judgment, nor be display'd in Tryumph over them.\\n\\nWhile the _Swallow_ was sending their Boat to fetch the Prisoners, a Blast\\nand Smoak was seen to pour out of the great Cabin, and they thought they\\nwere blowing up; but upon enquiry afterwards, found that half a dozen of\\nthe most Desperate, when they saw all Hopes fled, had drawn themselves\\nround what Powder they had left in the Steerage, and fired a Pistol into\\nit, but it was too small a Quantity to effect any Thing more, than burning\\nthem in a frightful Manner.\\n\\nThis Ship was commanded by one _Skyrme_, a _Welch_ Man, who, tho' he had\\nlost his Leg in the Action, would not suffer himself to be dressed, or\\ncarried off the Deck; but, like _Widrington_, fought upon his Stump. The\\nrest appeared gay and brisk, most of them with white Shirts, Watches, and a\\ndeal of Silk Vests, but the Gold-Dust belonging to them, was most of it\\nleft in the _Little Ranger_ in the Bay, (this Company's proper Ship,) with\\nthe _Royal Fortune._\\n\\nI cannot but take Notice of two among the Crowd, of those disfigured from\\nthe Blast of Powder just before mentioned, _viz. William Main_ and _Roger\\nBall._ An Officer of the Ship seeing a Silver Call hang at the Wast of the\\nformer, said to him, _I presume you are Boatswain of this Ship. Then you\\npresume wrong_, answered he, _for I am Boatswain of the_ Royal Fortune,\\n_Captain_ Roberts _Commander. Then Mr._ Boatswain _you will be hanged I\\nbelieve_, replies the Officer. _That is as your Honour pleases_, answered\\nhe again, and was for turning away: But the Officer desired to know of him,\\nhow the Powder, which had made them in that Condition, came to take\\nFire.--_By G_-- says he, _they are all mad and bewitch'd, for I have lost a\\ngood Hat by it._ (the Hat and he being both blown out of the Cabin Gallery,\\ninto the Sea.) _But what signifies a Hat Friend_, says the Officer.-_Not\\nmuch_ answer'd he, the Men being busy in stripping him of his Shoes and\\nStockings.--The Officer then enquired of him, whether _Roberts_'s Company\\nwere as likely Fellows as these.-- _There are_ 120 _of them_, (answered he)\\n_as clever Fellows as ever trod Shoe Leather: Would I were with them!--No\\ndoubt on't_, says the Officer.--_By G-- it is naked Truth_, answered he,\\nlooking down and seeing himself, by this Time, quite striped.\\n\\nThe Officer then approached _Roger Ball_, who was seated in a private\\nCorner, with a Look as sullen as Winter, and asked him, how he came blown\\nup in that frightful Manner.--_Why_, says he, John Morris _fired a Pistol\\ninto the Powder, and if he had not done it, I would_, (bearing his Pain\\nwithout the least Complaint.) The Officer gave him to understand he was\\nSurgeon, and if he desired it, he would dress him; but he swore it should\\nnot be done, and that if any Thing was applied to him, he would tear it\\noff.--Nevertheless the Surgeon had good Nature enough to dress him, tho'\\nwith much trouble: At Night he was in a kind of _Delirium_, and raved on\\nthe Bravery of _Roberts_, saying, he should shortly be released, as soon as\\nthey should meet him, which procured him a lashing down upon the\\nForecastle, which he resisting with all his Force, caused him to be used\\nwith the more Violence, so that he was tied down with so much Severity,\\nthat his Flesh being sore and tender with the blowing up, he died next Day\\nof a Mortification.\\n\\nThey secured the Prisoners with Pinions, and Shackles, but the Ship was so\\nmuch disabled in the Engagement, that they had once Thoughts to set her on\\nFire; but this would have given them the Trouble of taking the Pyrates\\nwounded Men on Board themselves, and that they were certain the _Royal\\nFortune_ would wait for their Consort's Return, they lay by her two Days,\\nrepaired her Rigging and other Damages, and sent her into _Princes_, with\\nthe _French_ Men, and four of their own Hands.\\n\\nOn the 9th in the Evening, the _Swallow_ gained the Cape again, and saw the\\n_Royal Fortune_ standing into the Bay with the _Neptune_, Captain _Hill_,\\nof _London_: A good Presage of the next Day's Success, for they did not\\ndoubt but the Temptation of Liquor, and Plunder, they might find in this\\ntheir new Prize, would make the Pyrates very confused; and so it happened.\\n\\nOn the 10th, in the Morning, the Man of War bore away to round the Cape.\\n_Roberts_'s Crew discerning their Masts over the Land, went down into the\\nCabin, to acquaint him of it, he being then at Breakfast with his new\\nGuest, Captain _Hill_, on a savory Dish of Solomongundy, and some of his\\nown Beer. He took no Notice of it, and his Men almost as little, some\\nsaying she was a _Portuguese_ Ship, others a _French_ Slave Ship, but the\\nmajor Part swore it was the _French Ranger_ returning, and were merrily\\ndebating for some Time, on the Manner of Reception, whether they should\\nsalute, or not; but as the _Swallow_ approached nigher, Things appeared\\nplainer, and though they were stigmatiz'd with the Name of Cowards, who\\nshewed any Apprehension of Danger, yet some of them, now undeceived,\\ndeclared it to _Roberts_, especially one _Armstrong_, who had deserted from\\nthat Ship, and knew her well: Those _Roberts_ swore at as Cowards, who\\nmeant to dishearten the Men, asking them if it were so, whether they were\\nafraid to fight, or no? And hardly refrained from Blows. What his own\\nApprehensions were, till she hawled up her Ports, and hoisted their proper\\nColours, is uncertain; but then being perfectly convinced, he slipped his\\nCable, got under Sail, and ordered his Men to Arms, without any shew of\\nTimidity, dropping a first Rate Oath, _that it was a Bite_, but, at the\\nsame Time, resolved, like a gallant Rogue, to get clear, or die.\\n\\nThere was one _Armstrong_, as I just mention'd, a Deserter from the\\n_Swallow_, whom they enquired of concerning the Trim and Sailing of that\\nShip; he told them she sail'd best upon a Wind, and therefore, if they\\ndesigned to leave her, they should go before it.\\n\\nThe Danger was imminent, and Time very short, to consult of Means to\\nextricate himself; his Resolution in this Streight, was as follows: To pass\\nclose to the _Swallow_, with all their Sails, and receive her Broadside,\\nbefore they returned a Shot; if disabled by this, or that they could not\\ndepend on sailing, then to run on Shore at the Point, (which is steep to)\\nand every one to shift for himself among the Negroes; or failing in these,\\nto board, and blow up together, for he saw that the greatest Part of his\\nMen were drunk, passively Couragious, unfit for Service.\\n\\n_Roberts_ himself made a gallant Figure, at the Time of the Engagement,\\nbeing dressed in a rich crimson Damask Wastcoat and Breeches, a red Feather\\nin his Hat, a Gold Chain round his Neck, with a Diamond Cross hanging to\\nit, a Sword in his Hand, and two Pair of Pistols hanging at the End of a\\nSilk Sling, flung over his Shoulders (according to the Fashion of the\\nPyrates;) and is said to have given his Orders with Boldness, and Spirit;\\ncoming, according to what he had purposed, close to the Man of War,\\nreceived her Fire, and then hoisted his Black Flag, and returned it,\\nshooting away from her, with all the Sail he could pack; and had he took\\n_Armstrong_'s Advice, to have gone before the Wind, he had probably\\nescaped; but keeping his Tacks down, either by the Winds shifting, or ill\\nSteerage, or both, he was taken a-back with his Sails, and the _Swallow_\\ncame a second Time very nigh to him: He had now perhaps finished the Fight\\nvery desperately, if Death, who took a swift Passage in a Grape-Shot, had\\nnot interposed, and struck him directly on the Throat. He settled himself\\non the Tackles of a Gun, which one _Stephenson_, from the Helm, observing,\\nran to his Assistance, and not perceiving him wounded, swore at him, and\\nbid him stand up, and fight like a Man; but when he found his Mistake, and\\nthat his Captain was certainly dead, he gushed into Tears, and wished the\\nnext Shot might be his Lot. They presently threw him over-board, with his\\nArms and Ornaments on, according to the repeated Request he made in his\\nLife-time.\\n\\n_Roberts_ was a tall black Man, near forty Years of Age, born at\\n_Newey-bagh_, nigh _Haverford-West_, in _Pembrokshire_, of good natural\\nParts, and personal Bravery, tho' he applied them to such wicked Purposes,\\nas made them of no Commendation, frequently drinking _D--n to him who ever\\nlived to wear a Halter._ He was forc'd himself at first among this Company\\nout of the _Prince_, Captain _Plumb_ at _Anamaboe_, about three Years\\nbefore, where he served as second Mate, and shed, as he us'd to tell the\\n_fresh Men_, as many Crocodile Tears then as they did now, but Time and\\ngood Company had wore it off. He could not plead Want of Employment, nor\\nIncapacity of getting his Bread in an honest way, to favour so vile a\\nChange, nor was he so much a Coward as to pretend it; but frankly own'd, it\\nwas to get rid of the disagreeable Superiority of some Masters he was\\nacquainted with, and the Love of Novelty and Change, Maritime\\nPeregrinations had accustom'd him to. _In an honest Service_, says he,\\n_there is thin Commons, low Wages, and hard Labour; in this, Plenty and\\nSatiety, Pleasure and Ease, Liberty and Power; and who would not ballance\\nCreditor on this Side, when all the Hazard that is run for it, at worst, is\\nonly a sour Look or two at choaking. No_, A merry Life and a short one,\\n_shall be my Motto._ Thus he preach'd himself into an Approbation of what\\nhe at first abhorr'd; and being daily regal'd with Musick, Drinking, and\\nthe Gaiety and Diversions of his Companions, these deprav'd Propensities\\nwere quickly edg'd and strengthen'd, to the extinguishing of Fear and\\nConscience. Yet among all the vile and ignominious Acts he had perpetrated,\\nhe is said to have had an Aversion towards forcing Men into that Service,\\nand had procured some their Discharge, notwithstanding so many made it\\ntheir Plea.\\n\\nWhen _Roberts_ was gone, as tho' he had been the Life and Soul of the Gang,\\ntheir Spirits sunk; many deserted their Quarters, and all stupidly\\nneglected any Means for Defence, or Escape; and their Main-mast soon after\\nbeing shot by the Board, they had no Way left, but to surrender and call\\nfor Quarters. The _Swallow_ kept aloof, while her Boat passed, and repassed\\nfor the Prisoners; because they understood they were under an Oath to blow\\nup; and some of the Desperadoes shewed a Willingness that Way, Matches\\nbeing lighted, and Scuffles happening between those who would, and those\\nwho opposed it: But I cannot easily account for this Humour, which can be\\nterm'd no more than a false Courage, since any of them had Power to destroy\\nhis own Life, either by Pistol, or Drowning, without involving others in\\nthe same Fate, who are in no Temper of Mind for it: And at best, it had\\nbeen only dying, for fear of Death.\\n\\nShe had 40 Guns, and 157 Men, 45 whereof were Negroes; three only were\\nkilled in the Action, without any Loss to the _Swallow._ There was found\\nupwards of 2000 _l._ in Gold-Dust in her. The Flag could not be got easily\\nfrom under the fallen Mast, and was therefore recover'd by the _Swallow_;\\nit had the Figure of a Skeleton in it, and a Man pourtray'd with a flaming\\nSword in his Hand, intimating a Defyance of Death it self.\\n\\nThe _Swallow_ returned back into Cape _Lopez_ Bay, and found the little\\n_Ranger_, whom the Pyrates had deserted in hast, for the better Defence of\\nthe Ship: She had been plunder'd, according to what I could learn, of 2000\\nl. in Gold-Dust, (the Shares of those Pyrates who belonged to her;) and\\nCaptain _Hill_, in the _Neptune_, not unjustly suspected, for he would not\\nwait the Man of War's returning into the Bay again, but sail'd away\\nimmediately, making no Scruple afterwards to own the Seizure of other Goods\\nout of her, and surrender'd, as a Confirmation of all, 50 Ounces at\\n_Barbadoes_, for which, see the Article at the End of this Book.\\n\\n_All Persons who after the_ 29_th of_ Septem. 1690, &c.\\n\\nTo sum up the whole, if it be considered, first, that the sickly State of\\nthe Men of War, when they sail'd from _Princes_, was the Misfortune that\\nhindered their being as far as _Sierraleon_, and consequently out of the\\nTrack the Pyrates then took. That those Pyrates, directly contrary to their\\nDesign, in the second Expedition, should get above Cape _Corso_, and that\\nnigh _Axim_, a Chace should offer, that inevitably must discover them, and\\nbe soon communicated to the Men of War. That the satiating their evil and\\nmalicious Tempers at _Whydah_, in burning the _Porcupine_, and running off\\nwith the _French_ Ship, had strengthened the _Swallow_ with 30 Men. That\\nthe _Swallow_ should miss them in that Road, where probably she had not, or\\nat least so effectually obtained her End. That they should be so far\\ninfatuated at Cape _Lopez_, as to divide their Strength, which when\\ncollected, might have been so formidable. And lastly, that the Conquest\\nshould be without Bloodshed: I say, considering all these Circumstances, it\\nshews that the Hand of Providence was concerned in their Destruction. As to\\ntheir Behaviour after they were taken, it was found that they had great\\nInclinations to rebel, if they could have laid hold of any Opportunity. For\\nthey were very uneasy under Restraint, having been lately all Commanders\\nthemselves; nor could they brook their Diet, or Quarters, without cursing\\nand swearing, and upbraiding each other, with the Folly that had brought\\nthem to it.\\n\\nSo that to secure themselves against any mad desperate Undertaking of\\ntheirs, they strongly barricado'd the Gun-Room, and made another Prison\\nbefore it; an Officer, with Pistols and Cutlashes, doing Duty, Night and\\nDay, and the Prisoners within, manacled and shackled.\\n\\nThey would yet in these Circumstances be impudently merry, saying, when\\nthey viewed their Nakedness, _that they had not left them a halfpenny, to\\ngive old_ Charon, _to ferry them over_ Stix: And at their thin Commons,\\nthey would observe, that they fell away so fast, that they should not have\\nWeight left to hang them. _Sutton_ used to be very prophane; he happening\\nto be in the same Irons with another Prisoner, who was more serious than\\nordinary, and read and pray'd often, as became his Condition; this Man\\n_Sutton_ used to swear at, and ask him, _what he proposed by so much Noise\\nand Devotion? Heaven_, says the other, _I hope. Heaven, you Fool_, says\\n_Sutton, did you ever hear of any Pyrates going thither? Give me H--ll,\\nit's a merrier Place; I'll give_ Roberts _a Salute of_ 13 _Guns at\\nEntrance._ And when he found such ludicrous Expressions had no Effect on\\nhim, he made a formal Complaint, and requested that the Officer would\\neither remove this Man, or take his Prayer-Book away, as a common\\nDisturber.\\n\\nA Combination and Conspiracy was formed, betwixt _Moody, Ashplant, Magnes,\\nMare_, and others, to rise, and kill the Officers, and run away with the\\nShip. This they had carried on by Means of a Mulatto Boy, who was allow'd\\nto attend them, and proved very trusty in his Messages, between the\\nPrincipals; but the Evening of that Night they were to have made this\\nStruggle, two of the Prisoners that sat next to _Ashplant_, heard the Boy\\nwhisper them upon the Project, and naming to him the Hour they should be\\nready, presently gave Notice of it to the Captain, which put the Ship in an\\nAlarm, for a little Time; and, on Examination, several of them had made\\nshift to break off, or lose, their Shackles, (no doubt for such Purpose;)\\nbut it tended only to procure to themselves worse Usage and Confinement.\\n\\nIn the same Passage to Cape _Corso_, the Prize, _Royal Fortune_, was in the\\nsame Danger. She was left at the Island of St. _Thomas_'s, in the\\nPossession of an Officer, and a few Men, to take in some fresh Provisions,\\n(which were scarce at Cape _Corso_) with Orders to follow the Ship. There\\nwere only some of the Pyrates Negroes, three or four wounded Prisoners, and\\n_Scudamore_, their Surgeon; from whom they seemed to be under no\\nApprehension, especially from the last, who might have hoped for Favour, on\\nAccount of his Employ; and had stood so much indebted for his Liberty,\\neating and drinking constantly with the Officer; yet this Fellow,\\nregardless of the Favour, and lost to all Sense of Reformation, endeavoured\\nto bring over the Negroes to his Design of murdering the People, and\\nrunning away with the Ship. He easily prevailed with the Negroes to come\\ninto the Design; but when he came to communicate it to his Fellow\\nPrisoners, and would have drawn them into the same Measures, by telling\\nthem, he understood Navigation, that the Negroes were stout Fellows, and by\\na Smattering he had in the _Angolan_ Language, he had found willing to\\nundertake such an Enterprize; and that it was better venturing to do this,\\nrun down the Coast, and raise a new Company, than to proceed to Cape\\n_Corso_, and be hanged like a Dog, and Sun dry'd. One of them abhorring the\\nCruelty, or fearing the Success, discovered it to the Officer, who made him\\nimmediately a Prisoner, and brought the Ship safe.\\n\\nWhen they came to be lodg'd in Cape _Corso-Castle_, their Hopes of this\\nkind all cut off, and that they were assured they must there soon receive a\\nfinal Sentence; the Note was changed among most of them, and from vain\\ninsolent jesting, they became serious and devout, begging for good Books,\\nand joyning in publick Prayers, and singing of Psalms, twice at least every\\nDay.\\n\\nAs to their Tryals, if we should give them at length, it may appear tedious\\nto the Reader, for which Reason, I have, for the avoiding Tautology and\\nRepetition, put as many of them together as were try'd for the same Fact,\\nreserving the Circumstances which are most material, with Observations on\\nthe dying Behaviour of such of them, as came to my Knowledge.\\n\\nAnd first, it may be observed from the List, that a great Part of these\\nPyrate Ships Crews, were Men entered on the Coast of _Africa_, not many\\nMonths before they were taken; from whence, it may be concluded, that the\\npretended Constraint of _Roberts_, on them, was very often a Complotment\\nbetween Parties equally willing: And this _Roberts_ several Times openly\\ndeclared, particularly to the _Onslow_'s People, whom he called aft, and\\nask'd of them, _who was willing to go, for he would force no Body?_ As was\\ndeposed, by some of his best Hands, after Acquittal; nor is it reasonable\\nto think, he should reject _Irish_ Voluntiers, only from a Pique against\\n_Kennedy_, and force others, that might hazard, and, in Time, destroy his\\nGovernment: But their Behaviour soon put him out of this Fear, and\\nconvinc'd him, that the Plea of Force was only the best Artifice they had\\nto shelter themselves under, in Case they should be taken; and that they\\nwere less Rogues than others, only in Point of Time.\\n\\nIt may likewise be taken Notice of, that the Country, wherein they happened\\nto be tried, is among other Happinesses, exempted from Lawyers, and\\nLaw-Books, so that the Office of Register, of necessity fell on one, not\\nversed in those Affairs, which might justify the Court in want of Form,\\nmore essentially supply'd with Integrity and Impartiality.\\n\\nBut, perhaps, if there was less Law, there might be more Justice, than in\\nsome other Courts; for, if the civil Law be a Law of universal Reason,\\njudging of the Rectitude, or Obliquity of Mens Actions, every Man of common\\nSense is endued with a Portion of it, at least sufficient to make him\\ndistinguish Right from Wrong, or what the Civilians call, _Malum in se._\\n\\nTherefore, here, if two Persons were equally Guilty of the same Fact, there\\nwas no convicting one, and bringing the other off, by any Quirk, or turn of\\nLaw; for they form'd their Judgments upon the Constraint, or Willingness,\\nthe Aim, and Intention of the Parties, and all other Circumstances, which\\nmake a material Difference. Besides, in Crimes of this Nature, Men bred up\\nto the Sea, must be more knowing, and much abler, than others more learned\\nin the Law; for, before a Man can have a right Idea of a Thing, he must\\nknow the Terms standing for that Thing: The Sea-Terms being a Language by\\nit self, which no Lawyer can be supposed to understand, he must of\\nConsequence want that discriminating Faculty, which should direct him to\\njudge right of the Facts meant by those Terms.\\n\\nThe Court well knew, it was not possible to get the Evidence of every\\nSufferer by this Crew, and therefore, first of all, considered how that\\nDeficiency should be supplied; whether, or no, they could pardon one _Jo.\\nDennis_, who had early offered himself, as King's Evidence, and was the\\nbest read in their Lives and Conversations: Here indeed, they were at a\\nLoss for Law, and concluded in the Negative, because it look'd like\\ncompounding with a Man to swear falsly, losing by it, those great Helps he\\ncould have afforded.\\n\\nAnother great Difficulty in their Proceedings, was, how to understand those\\nWords in the Act of Parliament, of, _particularly specifying in the Charge,\\nthe Circumstances of Time, Place_, &c. _i. e._ so to understand them, as to\\nbe able to hold a Court; for if they had been indicted on particular\\nRobberies, the Evidence had happened mostly from the Royal _African_\\nCompany's Ships, on which these Gentlemen of _Cape-Corso-Castle_, were not\\nqualify'd to sit, their Oath running, _That they have no Interest directly,\\nor indirectly, in the Ship, or Goods, for the Robbery of which, the Party\\nstands accused_: And this they thought they had, Commissions being paid\\nthem, on such Goods: And on the other Side, if they were incapacitated, no\\nCourt could be formed, the Commission absolutely requiring three of them by\\nName.\\n\\nTo reconcile all Things, therefore, the Court resolved, to bottom the whole\\nof their Proceedings on the _Swallow's_ Depositions, which were clear and\\nplain, and had the Circumstance of Time when, Place where, Manner how, and\\nthe like, particularly specified according to the Statute in that Case\\nmade, and provided. But this admitted only a general Intimation of Robbery\\nin the Indictment, therefore _to approve their Clemency_, it looking\\nArbitrary on the Lives of Men, to lump them to the Gallows, in such a\\nsummary Way as must have been done, had they solely adhered to the\\n_Swallow_'s Charge, they resolved to come to particular Tryals.\\n\\nSecondly, _That the Prisoners might not be ignorant whereon to answer_, and\\nso have all fair Advantages, to excuse and defend themselves; the Court\\nfarther agreed with Justice and Equanimity, to hear any Evidence that could\\nbe brought, to weaken or corroborate the three Circumstances that compleat\\na Pyrate; first, being a Voluntier amongst them at the Beginning; secondly,\\nbeing a Voluntier at the taking or robbing of any Ship; or lastly,\\nvoluntarily accepting a Share in the Booty of those that did; for by a\\nParity of Reason, where these Actions were of their own disposing, and yet\\ncommitted by them, it must be believed their Hearts and Hands joyned\\ntogether, in what they acted against his Majesty's Ship the _Swallow._\\n\\n_The_ TRYALS _of the_ PYRATES,\\n\\n_Taken by his Majesty's Ship the_ Swallow, _begun at Cape_\\nCorso-Castle, _on the Coast of_ Africa, March _the_ 28_th_, 1722.\\n\\nTHE Commission impowered any three named therein, to call to their\\nAssistance, such a Number of qualified Persons as might make the Court\\nalways consist of seven: And accordingly Summons were signed to Lieut. _Jo.\\nBarnsley_, Lieut. _Ch. Fanshaw_, Capt. _Samuel Hartsease_, and Capt.\\n_William Menzies, viz._\\n\\n   BY Virtue of a Power and Authority, to us given, by a\\n   Commission from the King, under the Seal of Admiralty,\\n   You are hereby required to attend, and make one of the\\n   Court, for the trying and adjudging of the Pyrates,\\n   lately taken on this Coast, by his Majesty's Ship the\\n   _Swallow._\\n\\nGiven under our Hands this 28th of _March_, 1722, at Cape\\n_Carso-Castle._\\n\\n_Mungo Heardman_, _James Phips_, _Henry Dodson_, _Francis Boy_,\\n_Edward Hide._\\n\\nThe Commissioners being met in the Hall of the Castle, the Commission was\\nfirst read, after which, the President, and then the other Members, took\\nthe Oath, prescribed in the Act of Parliament, and having directed the Form\\nof that for Witnesses, as follows, the Court was opened.\\n\\nI, A.

And have in\\nConformity to the most evil and mischievous Intentions, been twice down the\\nCoast of_ Africa, _with two Ships; once in the Beginning of_ August, _and a\\nsecond Time, in_ January _last, sinking, burning, or robbing such Ships,\\nand Vessels, as then happened in your Way._\\n\\n_Particularly, ye stand charged at the Instance, and Information of\\nCaptain_ Chaloner Ogle, _as Traytors and Pyrates, for the unlawful\\nOpposition ye made to his Majesty's Ship, the_ Swallow, _under his\\nCommand._\\n\\n_For that on the_ 5_th of_ February _last past, upon Sight of the aforesaid\\nKing's Ship, ye did immediately weigh Anchor from under Cape_ Lopez, _on\\nthe Southern Coast of_ Africa, _in a_ French _built Ship of_ 32 _Guns,\\ncalled the_ Ranger, _and did pursue and chase the aforesaid King's Ship,\\nwith such Dispatch and Precipitancy, as declared ye common Robbers and\\nPyrates._\\n\\n_That about Ten of the Clock the same Morning, drawing within Gun-shot of\\nhis Majesty's aforesaid Ship the_ Swallow, _ye hoisted a pyratical black\\nFlag, and fired several chace Guns, to deter, as much as ye were able, his\\nMajesty's Servants from their Duty._\\n\\n_That an Hour after this, being very nigh to the aforesaid King's Ship, ye\\ndid audaciously continue in a hostile Defence and Assault, for about two\\nHours more, in open Violation of the Laws, and in Defiance to the King's\\nColours and Commission._\\n\\n_And lastly, that in the acting, and compassing of all this, ye were all,\\nand every one of you, in a wicked Combination, voluntarily to exert, and\\nactually did, in your several Stations, use your utmost Endeavours to\\ndistress the said King's Ship, and murder his Majesty's good Subjects._\\n\\nTo which they severally pleaded, _Not Guilty._\\n\\n                                * * *\\n\\nThen the Court called for the Officers of the _Swallow_, Mr. _Isaac Sun_,\\nLieutenant, _Ralph Baldrick_, Boatswain, _Daniel Maclauglin_, Mate,\\ndesiring them to view the Prisoners, whether they knew them? And to give an\\nAccount in what Manner they had attack'd and fought the King's Ship; and\\nthey agreed as follows.\\n\\nThat they had viewed all the Prisoners, as they stood now before the Court,\\nand were assured they were the same taken out of one, or other, of the\\nPyrate Ships, _Royal Fortune_, or _Ranger_; but verily believe them to be\\ntaken out of the _Ranger._\\n\\nThat they did in the King's Ship, at break of Day, on _Monday_, the 5th of\\n_February_, 1721-2, discover three Ships at Anchor, under Cape _Lopez_, on\\nthe Southern Coast of _Africa_; the Cape bearing then W. S. W. about three\\nLeagues, and perceiving one of them to have a Pendant flying, and having\\nheard their Morning-Gun before, they immediately suspected them to be\\n_Roberts_ the Pyrate, his consort, and a _French_ Ship, they knew had been\\nlately carried out of _Whydah_ Road.\\n\\nThe King's Ship was obliged to hawl off N. W. and W. N. W. to avoid a Sand,\\ncalled, the _French Man's Bank_, the Wind then at S. S. E. and found in\\nhalf an Hour's time, one of the three had got under Sail from the Careen,\\nand was bending her Sails, in a Chace towards them. To encourage this\\nRashness and Precipitancy, they kept away before the Wind, (as though\\nafraid,) but with their Tacks on Board, their Main-Yard braced, and making,\\nat the same Time, very bad Steerage.\\n\\nAbout half an Hour after Ten, in the Morning, the Pyrate Ship came within\\nGun-shot, and fired four Chace Guns, hoisted a black Flag at the\\nMizen-Peek, and got their Sprit-sail Yard under their Bowsprit, for\\nboarding. In half an Hour more, approaching still nigher, they Starboarded\\ntheir Helm, and gave her a Broadside, the Pyrate bringing to, and returning\\nthe same.\\n\\nAfter this, the Deponents say, their Fire grew slack for some Time, because\\nthe Pyrate was shot so far a Head on the Weather-Bow, that few of their\\nGuns could Point to her; yet in this Interval their black Flag was either\\nShot away, or hawled down a little Space, and hoisted again.\\n\\nAt length, by their ill Steerage, and Favour of the Wind, they came near, a\\nsecond Time; and about Two in the Afternoon shot away their Main-topmast.\\n\\nThe Colours they fought under, besides a black Flag, were a red _English_\\nEnsign, a King's Jack, and a _Dutch_ Pendant, which they struck at, or\\nabout, Three in the Afternoon, and called for Quarters; it proving to be a\\n_French_ built Ship of 32 Guns, called the _Ranger._\\n\\n_Isaac Sun_, _Ralph Baldrick_, _Daniel Maclauglin._\\n\\nWhen the Evidence had been heard, the Prisoners were called upon to answer,\\nhow they came on Board this Pyrate Ship; and their Reason for so audacious\\na Resistance, as had been made against the King's Ship.\\n\\nTo this, each, in his Reply, owned himself to be one of those taken out of\\nthe _Ranger_; that he had signed their pyratical Articles, and shared in\\ntheir Plunder, some few only accepted, who had been there too short a Time.\\nBut that neither in this signing, or sharing, nor in the Resistance had\\nbeen made against his Majesty's Ship, had they been Voluntiers, but had\\nacted in these several Parts, from a Terror of Death; which a Law amongst\\nthem, was to be the Portion of those who refused. The Court then ask'd, who\\nmade those Laws? How those Guns came to be fired? Or why they had not\\ndeserted their Stations, and mutinied, when so fair a Prospect of\\nRedemption offered? They replied still, with the same Answers, and could\\nextenuate their Crimes, with no other Plea, than being forced Men.\\nWherefore the Court were of Opinion, that the Indictment, as it charged\\nthem with an unlawful Attack and Resistance of the King's Ship, was\\nsufficiently proved; but then it being undeniably evident, that many of\\nthese Prisoners had been forced, and some of them of very short standing,\\nthey did, on mature Deliberation, come to this merciful Resolution;\\n\\nThat they would hear further Evidence for, or against, each Person singly,\\nin Relation to those Parts of the Indictment, which declared them\\nVoluntiers, or charged them with aiding and assisting, at the burning,\\nsinking, or robbing of other Ships; for if they acted, or assisted, in any\\nRobberies or Devastations, it would be a Conviction they were Voluntiers;\\nhere such Evidence, though it might want the Form, still carried the Reason\\nof the Law with it.\\n\\nThe Charge was exhibited also against the following Pyrates taken\\nout of the _Royal Fortune._\\n\\n* Mich.

The Deponents\\nsay, they then struck the _French_ Ensign that had continued hoisted at\\ntheir Staff all the Morning till then; and display'd the King's Colours,\\ngiving her, at the same Time, their Broadside, which was immediately\\nreturned.\\n\\nThe Pyrate's Mizen-topmast fell, and some of her Rigging was torn, yet she\\nstill out sailed the Man of War, and slid half Gun-Shot from them, while\\nthey continued to fire without Intermission, and the other to return such\\nGuns as could be brought to bear, till by favour of the Winds, they were\\nadvanced very nigh again; and after exchanging a few more Shot, about half\\nan Hour past one, his Main-Mast came down, having received a Shot a little\\nbelow the Parrel.\\n\\nAt Two she struck her Colours, and called for Quarters, proving to be a\\nShip, formerly call'd the _Onslow_, but by them, the _Royal Fortune_; and\\nthe Prisoners from her, assured them, that the smallest Ship of the two,\\nthen remaining in the Road, belong'd to them, by the Name of the _Little\\nRanger_, which they had deserted on this Occasion.\\n\\n_Isaac Sun_, _Ralph Baldrick_, _Daniel Maclaughlin._\\n\\nThe Prisoners were asked by the Court, to the same Purpose the others had\\nbeen in the Morning; what Exception they had to make against what had been\\nsworn? And what they had to say in their Defence? And their Reply were much\\nthe same with the other Prisoners; that they were forc'd Men, had not fired\\na Gun in this Resistance against the _Swallow_, and that what little\\nAssistance they did give on this Occasion, was to the Sails and Rigging, to\\ncomply with the arbitrary Commands of _Roberts_, who had threaten'd, and\\nthey were perswaded would, have Shot them on Refusal.\\n\\nThe Court, to dispense equal Justice, mercifully resolved for these, as\\nthey had done for the other Pyrate Crew; that further Evidence should be\\nheard against each Man singly, to the two Points, of being a Voluntier at\\nfirst, and to their particular Acts of Pyracy and Robbery since: That so\\nMen, who had been lately received amongst them, and as yet, had not been at\\nthe taking, or plundering, of any Ship, might have the Opportunity, and\\nBenefit, of clearing their Innocence, and not fall promiscuously with the\\nGuilty.\\n\\n_By Order of the Court_, John Atkins, _Register._\\n\\n_Wm. Magnes, Tho. Oughterlauney, Wm. Main, Wm. Mackintosh, Val. Ashplant,\\nJohn Walden, Israel Hind, Marcus Johnson, Wm. Petty, Wm. Fernon, Abraham\\nHarper, Wm. Wood, Tho. How, John Stephenson, Ch. Bunce_, and _John Griffin_\\n\\nAgainst these it was deposed by Captain _Joseph Trahern_, and _George\\nFenn_, his Mate, that they were all of them, either at the attacking and\\ntaking of the Ship King _Solomon_, or afterwards at the robbing and\\nplundering of her, and in this Manner; That on the 6th of _January_ last\\ntheir Ship riding at Anchor near Cape _Appollonia_ in _Africa_, discovered\\na Boat rowing towards them, against Wind and Stream, from a Ship that lay\\nabout three Miles to Leeward. They judged from the Number of Men in her, as\\nshe nearer advanced, to be a Pyrate, and made some Preparation for\\nreceiving her, believing, on a nigher View, they would think fit to\\nwithdraw from an Attack that must be on their Side with great Disadvantage\\nin an open Boat, and against double the Number of Men; yet by the Rashness,\\nand the Pusillanimity of his own People (who laid down their Arms, and\\nimmediately called for Quarter) the Ship was taken, and afterwards robbed\\nby them.\\n\\n_President._ Can you charge your Memory with any Particulars in the Seizure\\nand Robbery?\\n\\n_Evidence._ We know that _Magnes_, Quarter-Master of the Pyrate Ship,\\ncommanded the Men in this Boat that took us, and assumed the Authority of\\nordering her Provisions and Stores out, which being of different Kinds, we\\nsoon found, were seized and sent away under more particular Directions; for\\n_Main_, as Boatswain of the Pyrate Ship, carried away two Cables, and\\nseveral Coils of Rope, as what belonged to his Province, beating some of\\nour own Men for not being brisk enough at working in the Robbery. _Petty_,\\nas Sail-maker, saw to the Sails and Canvas; _Harper_, as Cooper to the Cask\\nand Tools; _Griffin_, to the Carpenter's Stores, and _Oughterlauney_, as\\nPilot, having shifted himself with a Suit of my Clothes, a new tye Wig, and\\ncalled for a Bottle of Wine, ordered the Ship, very arrogantly, to be\\nsteered under Commadore _Robert_'s Stern, (I suppose to know what Orders\\nthere were concerning her.) So far particularly. In the general, Sir, they\\nwere very outragious and emulous in Mischief.\\n\\n_President._ Mr. _Castel_, acquaint the Court of what you know in Relation\\nto this Robbery of the King _Solomon_; after what Manner the Pyrate-Boat\\nwas dispatch'd for this Attempt.\\n\\n_Tho. Castel._ I was a Prisoner, Sir, with the Pyrates when their Boat was\\nordered upon that Service, and found, upon a Resolution of going, Word was\\npassed through the Company, Who would go? And I saw all that did, did it\\nvoluntarily; no Compulsion, but rather pressing who should be foremost.\\n\\nThe Prisoners yielded to what had been sworn about the Attack and Robbery,\\nbut denied the latter Evidence, saying, _Roberts_ hector'd, and upbraided\\nthem of Cowardice on this very Occasion; and told some, they were very\\nready to step on Board of a Prize when within Command of the Ship, but now\\nthere seem'd to be a Tryal of their Valour, backward and fearful.\\n\\n_President._ So that _Roberts_ forc'd ye upon this Attack.\\n\\n_Prisoners. Roberts_ commanded us into the Boat, and the Quarter-Master to\\nrob the Ship; neither of whose Commands we dared to have refused.\\n\\n_President._ And granting it so, those are still your own Acts, since done\\nby Orders from Officers of your own Election. Why would Men, honestly\\ndisposed, give their Votes for such a Captain and such a Quarter-Master as\\nwere every Day commanding them on distastful Services?\\n\\nHere succeeded a Silence among the Prisoners, but at length _Fernon_ very\\nhonestly own'd, that he did not give his Vote to _Magnes_, but to _David\\nSympson_ (the old Quarter-Master,) _for in Truth_, says he, _I took_ Magnes\\n_for too honest a Man, and unfit for the Business._\\n\\nThe Evidence was plain and home, and the Court, without any Hesitation,\\nbrought them in _Guilty._\\n\\nW_ILLIAM Church, Phil. Haak, James White, Nich. Brattle, Hugh Riddle,\\nWilliam Thomas, Tho. Roberts, Jo. Richards, Jo. Cane, R. Wood, R. Scot, Wm.\\nDavison, Sam. Morwell, Edward Evans, Wm. Guineys_, and 18 _French_ Men.\\n\\nThe four first of these Prisoners, it was evident to the Court, served as\\nMusick on Board the Pyrate, were forced lately from the several Merchant\\nShips they belonged to; and that they had, during this Confinement, an\\nuneasy Life of it, having sometimes their Fiddles, and often their Heads\\nbroke, only for excusing themselves, or saying they were tired, when any\\nFellow took it in his Head to demand a Tune.\\n\\nThe other _English_ had been a very few Days on Board the Pyrate, only from\\n_Whydah_ to Cape _Lopez_, and no Capture or Robbery done by them in that\\nTime. And the _French_ Men were brought with a Design to reconduct their\\nown Ship (or the _Little Ranger_ in Exchange) to _Whydah_ Road again, and\\nwere used like Prisoners; neither quarter'd nor suffered to carry Arms. So\\nthat the Court immediately acquiesced in, _Acquitting them._\\n\\nT_HO. Sutton, David Sympson, Christopher Moody, Phil. Bill, R. Hardy,\\nHen. Dennis, David Rice, Wm. Williams, R. Harris, Geo. Smith, Ed. Watts,\\nJo. Mitchell_ and _James Barrow._\\n\\nThe Evidence against these Prisoners, were _Geret de Haen_, Master of the\\n_Flushingham_, taken nigh _Axim_, the Beginning of _January_ last.\\n\\n_Benj. Kreft_ Master, and _James Groet_ Mate of the _Gertruycht_, taken\\nnigh _Gabone_ in _December_ last, and Mr. _Castel, Wingfield_ and others,\\nthat had been Prisoners with the Pyrates.\\n\\nThe former deposed, that all these Prisoners (excepting _Hardy_) were on\\nBoard at the Robbery and Plunder of their Ships, behaving in a vile\\noutragious Manner, putting them in bodily Fears, sometimes for the Ship,\\nand sometimes for themselves; and in particular, _Kreft_ charged it on\\n_Sutton_, that he had ordered all their Gunner's Stores out; on which that\\nPrisoner presently interrupted, and said, he was perjured, _That he had not\\ntaken half._ A Reply, I believe, not designed as any sawcy Way of jesting,\\nbut to give their Behaviour an Appearance of more Humanity than the _Dutch_\\nwould allow.\\n\\nFrom Mr. _Castel, Wingfield_ and others, they were proved to be\\ndistinguished Men, Men who were consulted as Chiefs in all Enterprizes;\\nbelonged most of them to the House of Lords, (as they call'd it,) and could\\ncarry an Authority over others. The former said, particularly of _Hardy_,\\n(Quarter-Master of the _Ranger_,) that when the _Diligence_ Sloop was\\ntaken, (whereto he belonged,) none was busier in the Plunder, and was the\\nvery Man who scuttled and sunk that Vessel.\\n\\nFrom some of the Prisoners acquitted, it was farther demanded, whether the\\nAcceptance or Refusal of any Office was not in their own Option? And it was\\ndeclared, that every Officer was chose by a Majority of Votes, and might\\nrefuse, if he pleased, since others gladly embraced what brought with it an\\nadditional Share of Prize. _Guilty_\\n\\n                                * * *\\n\\nThe Court on the 31st of _March_, remanded the following six before them,\\nfor Sentence, _viz. Dav. Sympson, Wm. Magnes, R. Hardy, Thomas Sutton,\\nChristopher Moody_, and _Valen.

H.\\n\\n_William Phillips._\\n\\nIT appeared by the Evidence of Captain _Jo. Trahern_, and _George\\nFenn_, Mate of the King _Solomon_, that this Prisoner was Boatswain of the\\nsame Ship, when she was attacked and taken off Cape _Appollonia_, the 6th\\nof _January_ last, by the Pyrate's Boat.\\n\\nWhen the Boat drew nigh, (they say,) it was judged from the Number of Men\\nin her, that they were Pyrates, and being hailed, answered, _Defiance_; at\\nwhich the Commander snatched a Musquet from one of his Men, and fired,\\nasking them at the same Time, whether they would stand by him, to defend\\nthe Ship? But the Pyrates returning a Volley, and crying out, they would\\ngive no Quarters if any Resistance was made; this Prisoner took upon him to\\ncall out for Quarters, without the Master's Consent, and mislead the rest\\nto the laying down their Arms, and giving up the Ship, to half the Number\\nof Men, and in an open Boat. It was further evident he became, after this,\\na Voluntier amongst them. First, because he was presently very forward and\\nbrisk, in robbing the Ship _King Solomon_, of her Provisions and Stores.\\nSecondly, because he endeavoured to have his Captain ill used; and lastly,\\nbecause he had confessed to _Fenn_, that he had been obliged to sign their\\nArticles that Night, (a Pistol being laid on the Table, to signify he must\\ndo it, or be shot,) when the whole appeared to be an Untruth from other\\nEvidence, who also asserted his being armed in the Action against the\\n_Swallow._\\n\\nIn answer to this, he first observed upon the Unhappiness of being\\nfriendless in this Part of the World, which, elsewhere, by witnessing to\\nthe Honesty of his former Life, would, he believed, in a great Measure,\\nhave invalidated the wrong Evidence had been given of his being a Voluntier\\nwith the Pyrates. He owns indeed, he made no Application to his Captain, to\\nintercede for a Discharge, but excuses it with saying, he had a dislike to\\nhim, and therefore was sure that such Application would have avail'd him\\nnothing.\\n\\nThe Court observed the Pretences of this, and other of the Pyrates, of a\\nPistol and their Articles being served up in a Dish together, or of their\\nbeing misused and forced from an honest Service, was often a Complotment of\\nthe Parties, to render them less suspected of those they came from, and was\\nto answer the End of being put in a News-Paper or Affidavit: and the\\nPyrates were so generous as not to refuse a Compliment to a Brother that\\ncost them nothing, and, at the same Time, secured them the best Hands; the\\nbest I call them, because such a Dependance made them act more boldly.\\n_Guilty._\\n\\n_Harry Glasby_, Master.\\n\\nTHere appearing several Persons in Court, who had been taken by\\n_Roberts_'s Ship, whereof the Prisoner was Master, their Evidence was\\naccepted as follows.\\n\\n_Jo. Trahern_, Commander of the _King Solomon_, deposed, the Prisoner,\\nindeed, to act as Master of the Pyrate Ship (while he was under Restraint\\nthere) but was observed like no Master, every one obeying at Discretion, of\\nwhich he had taken Notice, and complained to him, how hard a Condition it\\nwas, to be a Chief among Brutes; and that he was weary of his Life, and\\nsuch other Expressions, (now out of his Memory,) as shew'd in him a great\\nDisinclination to that Course of Living.\\n\\n_Jo. Wingfield_, a Prisoner with them at _Calabar_, says the same, as to\\nthe Quality he acted in, but that he was Civil beyond any of them, and\\nverily believes, that when the Brigantine he served on Board of, as a\\nFactor for the _African_ Company, was voted to be burnt, this Man was the\\nInstrument of preventing it, expressing himself with a great deal of\\nSorrow, for this and the like malicious Rogueries of the Company he was in;\\nthat to him shewed, he had acted with Reluctancy, as one who could not\\navoid what he did. He adds further, that when one _Hamilton_, a Surgeon,\\nwas taken by them, and the Articles about to be imposed on him, he opposed,\\nand prevented it. And that _Hunter_, another Surgeon, among them, was\\ncleared at the Prisoner's Instance and Perswasion; from which last, this\\nDeponent had it assured to him, that _Glasby_ had once been under Sentence\\nof Death, on Board of them, with two more, for endeavouring an Escape in\\nthe _West-Indies_, and that the other two were really shot for it.\\n\\n_Elizabeth Trengrove_, who was taken a Passenger in the _African_ Company's\\nShip _Onslow_, strengthen'd the Evidence of the last Witness; for having\\nheard a good Character of this _Glasby_, she enquired of the\\nQuarter-Master, who was then on Board a robbing, whether or no she could\\nsee him? And he told her, _No_; they never ventured him from the Ship, for\\nhe had once endeavoured his Escape, and they had ever since continued\\njealous of him.\\n\\n_Edward Crisp_, Captain _Trengrove_, and Captain _Sharp_, who had all been\\ntaken in their Turns, acknowledge for themselves and others, who had\\nunluckily fallen into those Pyrates Hands, that the good Usage they had met\\nwith, was chiefly thro' the Prisoner's Means, who often interposed, for\\nleaving sufficient Stores and Instruments on Board the Ships they had\\nrobbed, alledging, they were superfluous and unnecessary there.\\n\\n_James White_, whose Business was Musick, and was on the Poop of the Pyrate\\nShip in Time of Action with the _Swallow_, deposed, that during the\\nEngagement, and Defence she made, he never saw the Prisoner busied about\\nthe Guns, or giving Orders, either to the loading or firing of them; but\\nthat he wholly attended to the setting, or trimming, of the Sails, as\\n_Roberts_ commanded; and that in the Conclusion, he verily believed him to\\nbe the Man who prevented the Ship's being blown up, by setting trusty\\nCentinels below, and opposing himself against such hot-headed Fellows as\\nhad procured lighted Matches, and were going down for that Purpose.\\n\\n_Isaac Sun_, Lieutenant of the Man of War, deposed, that when he came to\\ntake Possession of the Prize, in the King's Boat, he found the Pyrates in a\\nvery distracted and divided Condition; some being for blowing up, and\\nothers (who perhaps supposed themselves least culpable) opposing it: That\\nin this Confusion he enquired for the Prisoner, of whom he had before heard\\na good Character; and thinks he rendered all the Service in his Power, for\\npreventing it; in particular, he understood by all Hands, that he had\\nseized, and taken, from one _James Philips_, a lighted Match, at the\\nInstant he was going down to the Magazine, swearing, that he should send\\nthem all to H--l together. He had heard also, that after _Roberts_ was\\nkilled, the Prisoner ordered the Colours to be struck; and had since shown,\\nhow opposite his Practice and Principles had been, by discovering who were\\nthe greatest Rogues among them.\\n\\nThe Prisoner, in his own Defence, says, when he had the Misfortune of\\nfalling into the Pyrates Hands, he was chief Mate of the _Samuel_, of\\n_London_, Captain _Cary_; and when he had hid himself, to prevent the\\nDesign of carrying him away, they found him, and beat and threw him\\nover-board. Seven Days afterwards, upon his objecting against, and refusing\\nto sign their Articles, he was cut and abus'd again: That tho' after this\\nhe ingratiated himself, by a more humble Carriage, it was only to make Life\\neasy; the Shares they had given him, having been from Time to Time returned\\nagain to such Prisoners as fell in his Way; till of late, indeed, he had\\nmade a small Reservation, and had desired Captain _Loan_ to take two or\\nthree Moidores from him, to carry to his Wife. He was once taken, he says,\\nat making his Escape, in the _West-Indies_, and, with two more, sentenced\\nto be shot for it, by a drunken Jury; the latter actually suffered, and he\\nwas preserved only by one of the chief Pyrates taking a sudden Liking to\\nhim, and bullying the others. A second time he ran away at _Hispaniola_,\\ncarrying a Pocket Compass, for conducting him through the Woods; but that\\nbeing a most desolate and wild Part of the Island he fell upon, and he\\nignorant how to direct his Course, was obliged, after two or three Days\\nwandering, to return towards the Ship again, denying with egregious Oaths,\\nthe Design he was charg'd with, for Fear they should shoot him. From this\\nTime he hopes it will be some Extenuation of his Fault, that most of the\\nacquitted Prisoners can witness, they entertained Jealousies of him, and\\n_Roberts_ would not admit him into his Secrets; and withal, that Captain\\n_Cary_, (and four other Passengers with him) had made Affidavit of his\\nhaving been forced from his Employ, which tho' he could not produce, yet he\\nhumbly hoped the Court would think highly probable from the Circumstances\\noffered.\\n\\nOn the whole, the Court was of Opinion Artists had the best Pretension to\\nthe Plea of Force, from the Necessity Pyrates are sometimes under of\\nengaging such, and that many Parts of his own Defence had been confirmed by\\nthe Evidence, who had asserted he acted with Reluctance, and had expressed\\na Concern and Trouble for the little Hopes remained to him, of extricating\\nhimself. That he had used all Prisoners (as they were called) well, at the\\nhazard of ill Usage to himself. That he had not in any military Capacity\\nassisted their Robberies. That he had twice endeavoured his Escape, with\\nthe utmost Danger. _Acquitted him._\\n\\nCaptain _James Skyrm._\\n\\nIT appeared from the Evidence of several Prisoners acquitted, that\\nthis _Skyrm_ commanded the _Ranger_, in that Defence she made against the\\nKing's Ship; that he ordered the Men to their Quarters, and the Guns to be\\nloaded and fired, having a Sword in his Hand, to enforce those Commands;\\nand beat such to their Duty whom he espied any way negligent or backward.\\nThat altho' he had lost a Leg in the Action, his Temper was so warm, as to\\nrefuse going off the Deck, till he found all was lost.\\n\\nIn his Defence, he says, he was forced from a Mate's Employ on Board a\\nSloop call'd the _Greyhound_, of St. _Christophers, Oct._ 1720. The Pyrate\\nhaving drubbed him, and broke his Head, only for offering to go away when\\nthat Sloop was dismissed. Custom and Success had since indeed blunted, and,\\nin some Measure, worn out the Sense of Shame; but that he had really for\\nseveral Months past been sick, and disqualified for any Duty, and though\\n_Roberts_ had forced him on this Expedition much against his Will, yet the\\nEvidence must be sensible, the Title of Captain gave him no Pre-eminence,\\nfor he could not be obeyed, though he had often called to them, to leave\\noff their Fire, when he perceived it to be the King's Ship.\\n\\nThe Sickness he alledged, but more especially the Circumstance of losing\\nhis Leg, were Aggravations of his Fault, shewing him more alert on such\\nOccasions, than he was now willing to be thought: As to the Name of\\nCaptain, if it were allowed to give him no Precedence out of Battle, yet\\nhere it was proved a Title of Authority; such an Authority as could direct\\nan Engagement against the King's Colours, and therefore he was in the\\nhighest Degree, _Guilty._\\n\\n_John Walden._\\n\\nCAptain _John Trahern_, and _George Fenn_, deposed, the Prisoner to\\nbe one of the Number, who, in an open Boat, pyratically assailed, and took\\ntheir Ship, and was remarkably busy at Mischief, having a Pole-Ax in his\\nHand, which served him instead of a Key, to all the lock'd Doors and Boxes\\nhe come nigh: Also in particular, he cut the Cable of our Ship, when the\\nother Pyrates were willing, and busied at heaving up the Anchor, saying,\\nCaptain, what signifies this Trouble of _Yo Hope_ and straining in hot\\nWeather; there are more Anchors at _London_, and besides, your Ship is to\\nbe burnt.\\n\\n_William Smith_, (a Prisoner acquitted,) says _Walden_ was known among the\\nPyrates mostly, by the Nick-Name of _Miss Nanney_ (ironically its presumed\\nfrom the Hardness of his Temper) that he was one of the twenty who\\nvoluntarily came on Board the _Ranger_, in the Chace she made out after the\\n_Swallow_, and by a Shot from that Ship, lost his Leg; his Behaviour in the\\nFight, till then, being bold and daring.\\n\\nThe _President_, called for _Harry Glasby_, and bid him relate a Character\\nof the Prisoner, and what Custom was among them, in Relation to these\\nvoluntary Expeditions, out of their proper Ship; and this of going on Board\\nthe _Ranger_, in particular.\\n\\nAnd he gave in for Evidence, that the Prisoner was looked on as a brisk\\nHand, (_i. e._ as he farther explained it, a stanch Pyrate, a great Rogue)\\nthat when the _Swallow_ first appeared in Sight, every one was willing to\\nbelieve her a _Portuguese_, because Sugar was very much in Demand, and had\\nmade some Jarring and Dissention between the two Companies, (the\\n_Fortune_'s People drinking Punch, when the _Ranger_'s could not) that\\n_Roberts_, on Sight of the _Swallow_, hailed the new _Ranger_, and bid them\\nright Ship, and get under Sail; there is, says he, Sugar in the Offing,\\nbring it in, that we may have no more Mumbling; ordering at the same Time\\nthe Word to be pass'd among the Crew, who would go to their Assistance, and\\nimmediately the Boat was full of Men, to transport themselves.\\n\\n_President._ Then every one that goes on Board of any Prize, does it\\nvoluntarily? Or were there here any other Reasons for it?\\n\\n_H. Glasby._ Every Man is commonly called by List, and insists, in his\\nTurn, to go on Board of a Prize, because they then are allowed a Shift of\\nCloaths, (the best they can find) over and above the Dividend from the\\nRobbery, and this they are so far from being compelled to, that it often\\nbecomes the Occasion of Contest and Quarrel amongst them: But in the\\npresent, or such like Cases, where there appears a Prospect of Trouble, the\\nLazy and Timerous are often willing to decline this Turn, and yield to\\ntheir Betters, who thereby establish a greater Credit.\\n\\nThe Prisoner, and the rest of those Men who went from the _Fortune_ on\\nBoard the _Ranger_, to assist in this Expedition, were Voluntiers, and the\\ntrustiest Men among us.\\n\\n_President._ Were there no Jealousies of the _Ranger_'s leaving you in this\\nChace, or at any other Time, in order to surrender?\\n\\n_H. Glasby._ Most of the _Ranger_'s Crew were fresh Men, Men who had been\\nenter'd only since their being on the Coast of _Guiney_, and therefore had\\nnot so liberal a Share in fresh Provisions, or Wine, as the _Fortune_'s\\nPeople, who thought they had born the Burthen and Heat of the Day, which\\nhad given Occasion indeed to some Grumblings and Whispers, as tho' they\\nwould take an Opportunity to leave us, but we never supposed (if they did)\\nit would be with any other Design then setting up for themselves, they\\nhaving (many of them) behaved with greater Severity than the old Standers.\\n\\nThe Prisoner appeared undaunted, and rather solicitous, about resting his\\nStump, than giving any Answer to the Court, or making any Defence for\\nhimself, till called upon; then he related in a careless, or rather\\nhopeless Manner, the Circumstances of his first Entrance, being forced, he\\nsaid, out of the _Blessing_ of _Lemmington_, at _Newfoundland_, about 12\\nMonths past; this, he is sure, most of the old Pyrates knew, and that he\\nwas for some Time as sick of the Change as any Man; but Custom and ill\\nCompany had altered him, owning very frankly, that he was at the Attack,\\nand taking of the _King Solomon_, that he did cut her Cable, and that none\\nwere forced on those Occasions.\\n\\nAs to the last Expedition in the _Ranger_, he confesses he went on Board of\\nher, but that it was by _Robert_'s Order; and in the Chace loaded one Gun,\\nto bring her to, but when he saw it was a Bite, he declared to his\\nComrades, that it was not worth while to resist, forbore firing, and\\nassisted to reeve the Braces, in order, if they could, to get away, in\\nwhich sort of Service he was busied, when a Shot from the Man of War took\\noff his Leg: And being asked, that supposing the Chace had proved a\\n_Portuguese_? Why then, says he, I dont know what I might have done,\\nintimating withal, that every Body then would have been ready enough at\\nplundering. _Guilty._\\n\\n_Peter Scudamore._\\n\\nH_Arry Glasby, Jo. Wingfield_, and _Nicholas Brattle_, depose thus\\nmuch, as to his being a Voluntier with the Pyrates, from Capt. _Rolls_, at\\n_Calabar._ First, That he quarrelled with _Moody_, (one of the Heads of the\\nGang) and fought with him, because he opposed his going, asking _Rolls_, in\\na leering manner, whether he would not be so kind, as to put him into the\\n_Gazette_, when he came Home. And, at another Time, when he was going from\\nthe Pyrate Ship, in his Boat, a Turnado arose, _I wish_, says he, _the\\nRascal may be drowned, for he is a great Rogue, and has endeavoured to do\\nme all the ill Offices he could among these Gentlemen_, (_i. e._Pyrates.)\\n\\nAnd secondly, That he had signed the Pyrate's Articles with a great deal of\\nAlacrity, and gloried in having been the first Surgeon that had done so,\\n(for before this, it was their Custom to change their Surgeons, when they\\ndesired it, after having served a Time, and never obliged them to sign, but\\nhe was resolved to break thro' this, for the good of those who were to\\nfollow,) swearing immediately upon it, he was now, he hoped, as great a\\nRogue as any of them.\\n\\nCaptain _Jo. Trahern_, and _George Fenn_, his Mate, deposed, the Prisoner\\nto have taken out of the _King Solomon_, their Surgeon's capital\\nInstruments, some Medicines, and a Back-Gammon Table; which latter became\\nthe Means of a Quarrel between one _Wincon_, and he, whose Property they\\nshould be, and were yielded to the Prisoner.\\n\\n_Jo. Sharp_, Master of the _Elizabeth_, heard the Prisoner ask _Roberts_\\nleave to force _Comry_, his Surgeon, from him, which was accordingly done,\\nand with him, carried also some of the Ship's Medicines: But what gave a\\nfuller Proof of the dishonesty of his Principles, was, the treacherous\\nDesign he had formed of running away with the Prize, in her Passage to Cape\\n_Corso_, though he had been treated with all Humanity, and very unlike a\\nPrisoner, on Account of his Employ and better Education, which had rendred\\nhim less to be suspected.\\n\\n_Mr. Child_, (acquitted) depos'd, that in their Passage from the Island of\\nSt. _Thomas_, in the _Fortune_ Prize, this Prisoner was several Times\\ntempting him, into Measures of rising with the Negroes, and killing the\\n_Swallow_'s People, shewing him, how easily the white Men might be\\ndemolished, and a new Company raised at _Angola_, and that Part of the\\nCoast, _for_, says he, _I understand how to navigate a Ship, and can soon\\nteach you to steer; and is it not better to do this, than to go back to_\\nCape-Corso, _and be hanged and Sun-dryed?_ To which the Deponent replying,\\nhe was not afraid of being hanged, _Scudamore_ bid him be still, and no\\nHarm should come to him; but before the next Day-Evening, which was the\\ndesigned Time of executing this Project, the Deponent discovered it to the\\nOfficer, and assured him, _Scudamore_ had been talking all the preceeding\\nNight to the Negroes, in _Angolan_ Language.\\n\\n_Isaac Burnet_ heard the Prisoner ask _James Harris_, a Pyrate, (left with\\nthe wounded in the Prize,) whether he was willing to come into the Project\\nof running away with the Ship, and endeavour the raising of a new Company,\\nbut turned the Discourse to Horse-Racing, as the Deponent crept nigher; he\\nacquainted the Officer with what he had heard, who kept the People under\\nArms all Night, their Apprehensions of the Negroes not being groundless;\\nfor many of them having lived a long Time in this pyratical Way, were, by\\nthe thin Commons they were now reduced to, as ripe for Mischief as any.\\n\\nThe Prisoner in his Defence said, he was a forced Man from Captain _Rolls_,\\nin _October_ last, and if he had not shewn such a Concern as became him, at\\nthe Alteration, he must remark the Occasion to be, the Disagreement and\\nEnmity between them; but that both _Roberts_, and _Val. Ashplant_,\\nthreat'ned him into signing their Articles, and that he did it in Terror.\\n\\nThe _King Solomon_, and _Elizabeth_ Medicine-Chest, he owns he plundered,\\nby Order of _Hunter_, the then chief Surgeon, who, by the Pyrates Laws,\\nalways directs in this Province, and Mr. _Child_, (tho' acquitted) had by\\nthe same Orders taken out a whole _French_ Medicine-Chest, which he must be\\nsensible for me, as well as for himself, we neither of us dared to have\\ndenied; it was their being the proper Judges, made so ungrateful an Office\\nimposed. If after this he was elected chief Surgeon himself, both _Comry_\\nand _Wilson_ were set up also, and it might have been their Chance to have\\ncarried it, and as much out of their Power to have refused.\\n\\nAs to the Attempt of rising and running away with the Prize, he denies it\\naltogether as untrue; a few foolish Words, but only by Way of Supposition,\\nthat if the Negroes should take it in their Heads (considering the\\nWeakness, and ill look-out that was kept;) it would have been an easy\\nMatter, in his Opinion for them to have done it; but that he encouraged\\nsuch a Thing, was false, his talking to them in the _Angolan_ Language, was\\nonly a Way of spending his Time, and trying his Skill to tell twenty, he\\nbeing incapable of further Talk. As to his understanding Navigation, he had\\nfrequently acknowledg'd it to the Deponent _Child_, and wonders he should\\nnow so circumstantiate this Skill against him. _Guilty._\\n\\n_Robert Johnson._\\n\\nIT appeared to the Court, that the Prisoner was one of the twenty\\nMen, in that Boat of the Pyrates, which afterwards robb'd the _King\\nSolomon_, at an Anchor near Cape _Appollonia_: That all Pyrates on this,\\nand the like Service, were Voluntiers, and he, in particular, had contested\\nhis going on Board a second Time, tho' out of his Turn.\\n\\nThe Prisoner in his Defence, called for _Harry Glasby_, who witnessed to\\nhis being so very drunk, when he first came among their Crew, that they\\nwere forced to hoist him out of one Ship into the other, with a Tackle, and\\ntherefore without his Consent; but had since been a trusty Man, and was\\nplaced to the Helm, in that running Battle they made with the _Swallow._\\n\\nHe insisted for himself likewise, on Captain _Turner_'s Affidavit of his\\nbeing forced, on which others (his Ship-mates) had been cleared.\\n\\nThe Court considering the Partiality that might be objected in acquitting\\none, and condemning another of the same standing, thought sit to remark it\\nas a clear Testimony of their Integrity, that their Care and Indulgence to\\neach Man, in allowing his particular Defence, was to exempt from the Rigour\\nof the Law, such, who it must be allowed, would have stood too\\npromiscuously condemned, if they had not been heard upon any other Fact\\nthan that of the _Swallow_; and herein what could better direct them, than\\na Character and Behaviour from their own Associates; for tho' a voluntary\\nEntry with the Pyrates may be doubtful, yet his consequent Actions are not,\\nand it is not so material how a Man comes among Pyrates, as how he acts\\nwhen he is there. _Guilty._\\n\\n_George Wilson._\\n\\nJ_OHN Sharp_, Master of the _Elizabeth_, in which Ship the Prisoner\\nwas Passenger, and fell a second Time into the Pyrates Hands, deposes, that\\nhe took the said _Wilson_ off from _Sestos_, on this Coast, paying to the\\nNegroes for his Ransom, the Value of three Pound five Shillings in Goods,\\nfor which he had taken a Note, that he thought he had done a charitable Act\\nin this, till meeting with one Captain _Canning_, he was ask'd, why he\\nwould release such a Rogue as _Wilson_ was? For that he had been a\\nVoluntier with the Pyrates, out of _John Tarlton._ And when the Deponent\\ncame to be a Prisoner himself, he found _Thomas_, the Brother of this _John\\nTarlton_, a Prisoner with the Pyrates also, who was immediately on\\n_Wilson_'s Instigation, in a most sad manner misused and beat, and had been\\nshot, through the Fury and Rage of some of those Fellows, if the Town-side,\\n(_i. e. Liverpool_) Men, had not hid him in a Stay-Sail, under the\\nBowsprit; for _Moody_ and _Harper_, with their Pistols cock'd, searched\\nevery Corner of the Ship to find him, and came to this Deponent's Hammock,\\nwhom they had like fatally to have mistaken for _Tarlton_, but on his\\ncalling out, they found their Error, and left him with this comfortable\\nAnodyne, That he was the honest Fellow who brought the Doctor. At coming\\naway, the Prisoner asked about his Note, whether the Pyrates had it or no?\\nWho not being able readily to tell, he reply'd, it's no Matter Mr. _Sharp_,\\nI believe I shall hardly ever come to _England_ to pay it.\\n\\n_Adam Comry_, Surgeon of the _Elizabeth_, says, that altho' the Prisoner\\nhad, on Account of his Indisposition and Want, received many Civilities\\nfrom him, before meeting with the Pyrates, he yet understood it was thro'\\nhis and _Scudamore_'s Means, that he had been compelled among them: The\\nPrisoner was very alert and chearful, he says, at meeting with _Roberts_,\\nhailed him, told him he was glad to see him, and would come on Board\\npresently, borrowing of the Deponent a clean Shirt and Drawers, for his\\nbetter Appearence and Reception; he signed their Articles willingly, and\\nused Arguments with him to do the same, saying, they should make their\\nVoyage in eight Months, to _Brasil_, Share 6 or 700 _l._ a Man, and then\\nbreak up. Again, when the Crew came to an Election of a chief Surgeon, and\\nthis Deponent was set up with the others, _Wilson_ told him, he hoped he\\nshould carry it from _Scudamore_, for that a quarter Share (which they had\\nmore than others) would be worth looking after; but the Deponent missed the\\nPreferment, by the good Will of the _Ranger_'s People, who, in general,\\nvoted for _Scudamore_, to get rid of him, (the chief Surgeon being always\\nto remain with the Commadore.)\\n\\nIt appeared likewise by the Evidence of Captain _Jo. Trahern, Tho. Castel_,\\nand others, who had been taken by the Pyrates, and thence had Opportunities\\nof observing the Prisoners Conduct, that he seem'd thoroughly satisfy'd\\nwith that Way of Life, and was particularly intimate with _Roberts_; they\\noften scoffing at the Mention of a Man of War, and saying, if they should\\nmeet with any of the Turnip-Man's Ships, they would blow up, and go to\\nH--ll together. Yet setting aside these silly Freaks, to recommend himself,\\nhis Laziness had got him many Enemies, even _Roberts_ told him, (on the\\nComplaint of a wounded Man, whom he had refused to dress) that he was a\\ndouble Rogue, to be there a second Time, and threat'ned to cut his Ears\\noff.\\n\\nThe Evidence further assured the Court, from Captain _Thomas Tarlton_, that\\nthe Prisoner was taken out of his Brother's Ship, some Months before, a\\nfirst Time, and being forward to oblige his new Company, had presently\\nask'd for the Pyrates Boat, to fetch the Medicine Chest away; when the Wind\\nand Current proving too hard to contend with, they were drove on Shore at\\nCape _Montzerado._\\n\\nThe Prisoner called for _William Darling_, and _Samuel Morwel_, (acquitted)\\nand _Nicholas Butler._\\n\\n_William Darling_ deposed, the first Time the Prisoner fell into their\\nHands, _Roberts_ mistook him for _Jo. Tarlton_ the Master, and being\\ninformed it was the Surgeon who came to represent him, (then indisposed,)\\nhe presently swore he should be his Mess-Mate, to which _Wilson_ reply'd,\\nhe hop'd not, he had a Wife and Child, which the other laughed at; and that\\nhe had been two Days on Board, before he went in that Boat, which was drove\\non Shore at Cape _Montzerado._ And at his second coming, in the\\n_Elizabeth_, he heard _Roberts_ order he should be brought on Board in the\\nfirst Boat.\\n\\n_Samuel Morwel_ says, that he has heard him bewail his Condition, while on\\nBoard the Pyrate, and desired one _Thomas_, to use his Interest with\\n_Roberts_, for a Discharge, saying, his Employ, and the little Fortune he\\nhad left at Home, would, he hop'd, exempt him the further Trouble of\\nseeking his Bread at Sea.\\n\\n_Nicholas Butler_, who had remained with the Pyrates about 48 Hours, when\\nthey took the _French_ Ships at _Whydah_, deposes, that in this Space the\\nPrisoner addressed him in the _French_ Language, several Times, deploring\\nthe Wretchedness and ill Fortune of being confined in such Company.\\n\\nThe Prisoner desiring Liberty of two or three Questions, ask'd, whether or\\nno he had not expostulated with _Roberts_, for a Reason of his obliging\\nSurgeons to sign their Articles, when heretofore they did not; Whether he\\nhad not expressed himself glad of having formerly escaped from them?\\nWhether he had not said, at taking the Ships in _Whydah_ Road, that he\\ncould like the Sport, were it lawful? And whether if he had not told him,\\nshould the Company discharge any Surgeon, that he would insist on it as his\\nTurn? The Deponent answered, Yes, to every Question separately; and\\nfarther, that he believes _Scudamore_ had not seen _Wilson_ when he first\\ncame and found him out of the _Elizabeth._\\n\\nHe added, in his own Defence, that being Surgeon with one _John Tarlton_,\\nof _Leverpool_, he was met a first Time on this Coast of _Guiney_, by\\n_Roberts_ the Pyrate; who, after a Day or two, told him, to his Sorrow,\\nthat he was to stay there, and ordered him to fetch his Chest, (not\\nMedicines, as asserted,) which Opportunity he took to make his Escape; for\\nthe Boat's Crew happening to consist of five _French_ and one _English_\\nMan, all as willing as himself, they agreed to push the Boat on Shore, and\\ntrust themselves with the Negroes of Cape _Montzerado_: Hazardous, not only\\nin Respect of the dangerous Seas that run there, but the Inhumanity of the\\nNatives, who sometimes take a liking to humane Carcasses. Here he remained\\nfive Months, till _Thomas Tarlton_, Brother to his Captain chanced to put\\nin the Road for Trade, to whom he represented his Hardships and starving\\nCondition; but was, in an unchristian Manner, both refused a Release of\\nthis Captivity, or so much as a small Supply of Biscuit and salt Meat,\\nbecause, as he said, he had been among the Pyrates. A little Time after\\nthis, the Master of a _French_ Ship paid a Ransom for him, and took him\\noff; but, by Reason of a nasty leperous Indisposition he had contracted by\\nhard and bad living, was, to his great Misfortune set ashore at _Sestos_\\nagain, when Captain _Sharp_ met him, and generously procured his Release in\\nthe Manner himself has related, and for which he stands infinitely\\nobliged.--That ill Luck threw him a second Time into the Pyrate's Hands, in\\nthis Ship _Elizabeth_, where he met _Thomas Tarlton_, and thoughtlesly used\\nsome Reproaches of him, for his severe Treatment at _Montzerado_; but\\nprotests without Design his Words should have had so bad a Consequence; for\\n_Roberts_ took upon him, as a Dispenser of Justice, the Correction of Mr.\\n_Tarlton_, beating him unmercifully; and he hopes it will be belived,\\ncontrary to any Intention of his it should so happen, because as a Stranger\\nhe might be supposed to have no Influence, and believes there were some\\nother Motives for it.--He cannot remember he expressed himself glad to see\\n_Roberts_ this second Time, or that he dropped those Expressions about\\n_Comry_, as are sworn; but if immaturity of Judgment had occasioned him to\\nslip rash and inadvertent Words, or that he had paid any undue Compliments\\nto _Roberts_, it was to ingratiate himself, as every Prisoner did, for a\\nmore civil Treatment, and in particular to procure his Discharge, which he\\nhad been promised, and was afraid would have been revoked, if such a Person\\nas _Comry_ did not remain there to supply his Room; and of this, he said,\\nall the Gentlemen (meaning the Pyrates) could witness for him.\\n\\nHe urged also his Youth in Excuse for his Rashness.--The first time he had\\nbeen with them (only a Month in all,) and that in no military Employ; but\\nin particular, the Service he had done in discovering the Design the\\nPyrates had to rise in their Passage on Board the _Swallow. Guilty._\\n\\n                                * * *\\n\\nBut Execution respited till the King's Pleasure be known, because the\\nCommander of the _Swallow_ had declared, the first Notice he received of\\nthis Design of the Pyrates to rise, was from him.\\n\\n_Benjamin Jefferys_\\n\\nBY the Depositions of _Glasby_ and _Lillburn_ (acquitted) against\\nthis Prisoner, it appeared, that his Drunkenness was what at first detained\\nhim from going away in his proper Ship, the _Norman_ Galley; and next\\nMorning, for having been abusive in his Drink, saying to the Pyrates, there\\nwas not a Man amongst them, he received for a Welcome, six Lashes from\\nevery Person in the Ship, which disordered him for some Weeks, but on\\nRecovery was made Boatswain's Mate; the serving of which, or any Office on\\nBoard a Pyrate, is at their own Option, (tho' elected,) because others are\\nglad to accept what brings an additional Share in Prize.\\n\\nThe Deponents further say, that at _Sierraleon_ every Man had more\\nespecially the Means of escaping; and that this Prisoner, in particular,\\nneglected it, and came off from that Place after their Ship was under Sail,\\nand going out of the River.\\n\\nThe Prisoner, in his Defence, protests, he was at first forc'd; and that\\nthe Office of Boatswain's Mate was imposed on him, and what he would have\\nbeen glad to have relinquish'd. That the barbarous Whipping he had received\\nfrom the Pyrates at first, was for telling them, that none who could get\\ntheir Bread in an honest Way, would be on such an Account. And he had\\ncertainly taken the Opportunity which presented at _Sierraleon_, of ridding\\nhimself from so distastful a Life, if there had not been three or four of\\nthe old Pyrates on Shore at the same Time, who, he imagined, must know of\\nhim, and would doubtless have served him the same, if not worse, than they\\nsince had done _William Williams_; who, for such a Design, being delivered\\nup by the treacherous Natives, had received two Lashes thro' the whole\\nShip's Company.\\n\\nThe Court observed, the Excuses of these Pyrates, about want of Means to\\nescape, was oftentimes as poor and evasive as their Pleas of being forced\\nat first; for here, at _Sierraleon_, every Man had his Liberty on Shore,\\nand it was evident, might have kept it, if he, or they, had so pleased. And\\nsuch are further culpable, who having been introduced into the Society, by\\nsuch uncivil Methods, as whipping, or beating, neglect less likely Means of\\nregaining Liberty; it shews strong Inclinations to Dishonesty, and they\\nstand inexcusably, _Guilty._\\n\\n_Jo. Mansfield._\\n\\nIT was proved against this Prisoner, by Captain _Trahern_ and _George\\nFenn_, that he was one of those Voluntiers who was at the Attack and\\nRobbery of the Company's Ship, called the _King Solomon_: That he bully'd\\nwell among them who dar'd not make any Reply, but was very easy with his\\nFriends, who knew him; for _Moody_, on this Occasion, took a large Glass\\nfrom him, and threatned to blow his Brains out, (a favourite Phrase with\\nthese Pyrates) if he muttered at it.\\n\\nFrom others acquitted, it likewise appeared, that he was at first a\\nVoluntier among them, from an Island call'd _Dominico_, in the\\n_West-Indies_, and had to recommend himself, told them, he was a Deserter\\nfrom the _Rose_ Man of War, and before that, had been on the High-Way; he\\nwas always drunk, they said, and so bad at the Time they met with the\\n_Swallow_, that he knew nothing of the Action, but came up vapouring with\\nhis Cutlash, after the _Fortune_ had struck her Colours, to know who would\\ngo on Board the Prize; and it was some Time before they could perswade him\\ninto the Truth of their Condition.\\n\\nHe could say little in Defence of himself, acknowledg'd this latter Part of\\nDrunkenness; a Vice, he says, that had too great a Share in insnaring him\\ninto this Course of Life, and had been a greater Motive with him than Gold.\\n_Guilty._\\n\\n_William Davis._\\n\\nW_Illiam Allen_ deposed, he knew this Prisoner at _Sierraleon_,\\nbelonging to the _Ann_ Galley; that he had a Quarrel with, and beat the\\nMate of that Ship, for which (as he said) being afraid to return to his\\nDuty, he consorted to the idle Customs and Ways of living among the\\nNegroes, from whom he received a Wife, and ungratefully sold her, one\\nEvening, for some Punch to quench his Thirst. After this, having put\\nhimself under the Protection of Mr. _Plunket_, Governor there for the Royal\\n_African_ Company: The Relations and Friends of the Woman, apply'd to him\\nfor Redress, who immediately surrendered the Prisoner, and told them, he\\ndid not care if they took his Head off; but the Negroes wisely judging it\\nwould not fetch so good a Price, they sold him in his Turn again to\\nSeignior _Jossee_, a Christian Black, and Native of that Place; who\\nexpected and agreed for two Years Service from him, on Consideration of\\nwhat he had disbursed, for the Redemption of the Woman: But long before the\\nExpiration of this Time, _Roberts_ came into _Sierraleon_ River, where the\\nPrisoner, (as Seignior _Jossee_ assured the Deponent,) entered a Voluntier\\nwith them.\\n\\nThe Deponent further corroborates this Part of the Evidence; in that he\\nbeing obliged to call at Cape _Mount_, in his Passage down hither, met\\nthere with two Deserters from _Roberts_'s Ship, who assured him of the\\nsame; and that the Pyrates did design to turn _Davis_ away the next\\nOpportunity, as an idle good-for-nothing Fellow.\\n\\nFrom _Glasby_ and _Lilburn_, it was evident, that every Pyrate, while they\\nstay'd at _Sierraleon_, went on Shore at Discretion. That _Roberts_ had\\noften assured Mr. _Glyn_ and other Traders, at that Place, that he would\\nforce no Body; and in short, there was no Occasion for it; in particular,\\nthe Prisoner's Row-Mate went away, and thinks, he might have done the same,\\nif he had pleased.\\n\\nThe Prisoner alledged his having been detained against his Will, and says,\\nthat returning with Elephants Teeth for _Sierraleon_, the Pyrate's Boat\\npursued and brought him on Board, where he was kept on Account of his\\nunderstanding the Pilotage and Navigation of that River.\\n\\nIt was obvious to the Court, not only how frivolous Excuses of Constraint\\nand Force were among these People, at their first commencing Pyrates, but\\nalso it was plain to them, from these two Deserters, met at Cape _Mount_,\\nand the discretional Manner they lived in, at _Sierraleon_; thro' how\\nlittle Difficulty several of them did, and others might, have escaped\\nafterwards, if they could but have obtained their own Consents for it.\\n_Guilty._\\n\\n                                * * *\\n\\nThis is the Substance of the Tryals of _Roberts_'s Crew, which may suffice\\nfor others, that occur in this Book.

A Gentleman, who was Surgeon of the Ship, was so\\ncharitable at this Time, to offer himself in the room of an Ordinary, and\\nrepresented to them, as well as he was able, the Heinousness of their Sin,\\nand Necessity which lay on them of Repentance; one particular Part of which\\nought to be, acknowledging the Justice they had met with. They seem'd\\nheedless for the present, some calling for Water to drink, and others\\napplying to the Soldiers for Caps, but when this Gentleman press'd them for\\nan Answer, they all exclaim'd against the Severity of the Court, and were\\nso harden'd, as to curse, and wish the same Justice might overtake all the\\nMembers of it, as had been dealt to them. _They were poor Rogues_, they\\nsaid, _and so hang'd, while others, no less guilty in another Way,\\nescaped._\\n\\nWhen he endeavoured to compose their Minds, exhorting them to dye in\\nCharity with all the World, and would have diverted them from such vain\\nDiscourse, by asking them their Country, Age, and the like; some of them\\nanswered, `What was that to him, they suffered the Law, and should give no\\nAccount but to God;´ walking to the Gallows without a Tear, in Token of\\nSorrow for their past Offences, or shewing as much Concern as a Man would\\nexpress at travelling a bad Road; nay, _Sympson_, at seeing a Woman that he\\nknew, said, `he had lain with that B--h three times, and now she was come\\nto see him hang'd.´ And _Hardy_, when his Hands were ty'd behind him,\\n(which happened from their not being acquainted with the Way of bringing\\nMalefactors to Execution,) observed, `that he had seen many a Man hang'd,\\nbut this Way of the Hands being ty'd behind them, he was a Stranger to, and\\nnever saw before in his Life.´ I mention these two little Instances, to\\nshew how stupid and thoughtless they were of their End, and that the same\\nabandoned and reprobate Temper that had carried them thro' their Rogueries,\\nabided with them to the last.\\n\\n_Samuel Fletcher_, another of the Pyrates ordered for Execution, but\\nreprieved, seem'd to have a quicker Sense of his Condition; for when he saw\\nthose he was allotted with gone to Execution, he sent a Message by the\\nProvost-Marshal to the Court, to be `inform'd of the Meaning of it, and\\nhumbly desir'd to know whether they design'd him Mercy, or not? If they\\ndid, he stood infinitely oblig'd to them, and thought the whole Service of\\nhis Life an incompetent Return for so great a Favour; but that if he was to\\nsuffer, the sooner the better, _he said_, that he might be out of his\\nPain.´\\n\\nThere were others of these Pyrates the reverse of this, and tho' destitute\\nof Ministers, or fit Persons to represent their Sins, and assist them with\\nspiritual Advice, were yet always imploying their Time to good Purposes,\\nand behaved with a great deal of seeming Devotion and Penitence; among\\nthese may be reckon'd _Scudamore, Williams, Philips, Stephenson, Jefferys,\\nLesly, Harper, Armstrong, Bunce_, and others.\\n\\n_Scudamore_ too lately discerned the Folly and Wickedness of the\\nEnterprize, that had chiefly brought him under Sentence of Death, from\\nwhich, seeing there was no Hopes of escaping, he petitioned for two or\\nthree Days Reprieve, which was granted; and for that Time apply'd himself\\nincessantly to Prayer, and reading the Scriptures, seem'd to have a deep\\nSense of his Sins, of this in particular, and desired, at the Gallows, they\\nwould have Patience with him, to sing the first Part of the thirty first\\nPsalm; which he did by himself throughout.\\n\\n_Armstrong_, having been a Deserter from his Majesty's Service, was\\nexecuted on Board the _Weymouth_, (and the only one that was;) there was no\\nBody to press him to an Acknowledgement of the Crime he died for, nor of\\nsorrowing in particular for it, which would have been exemplary, and made\\nsuitable Impressions on Seamen; so that his last Hour was spent in\\nlamenting and bewailing his Sins in general, exhorting the Spectators to an\\nhonest and good Life, in which alone they could find Satisfaction. In the\\nEnd, he desir'd they would join with him in singing two or three latter\\nVerses of the 140th Psalm; and that being concluded, he was, at the firing\\nof a Gun, tric'd up at the Fore-Yard-Arm.\\n\\n_Bunce_ was a young Man, not above 26 Years old, but made the most\\npathetical Speech of any at the Gallows. He first declaim'd against the\\nguilded Bates of Power, Liberty, and Wealth, that had ensnar'd him among\\nthe Pyrates, his unexperienc'd Years not being able to withstand the\\nTemptation; but that the Briskness he had shewn, which so fatally had\\nprocured him Favour amongst them, was not so much a Fault in Principle, as\\nthe Liveliness and Vivacity of his Nature. He was now extreamly afflicted\\nfor the Injuries he had done to all Men, and begg'd their's and God's\\nForgiveness, very earnestly exhorting the Spectators to remember their\\nCreator in their Youth, and guard betimes, that their Minds took not a\\nwrong Byass, concluding with this apt Similitude, _That he stood there as a\\nBeacon upon a Rock_, (the Gallows standing on one) _to warn erring\\nMarriners of Danger._\\n\\nCHAP. X. OF Captain _ANSTIS_, And his CREW.\\n\\nT_HOMAS Anstis_ ship'd himself at _Providence_ in the Year 1718,\\naboard the _Buck_ Sloop, and was one of six that conspired together to go\\noff a pyrating with the Vessel; the rest were, _Howel Davis, Roberts_'s\\nPredecessor, killed at the Island of _Princes; Dennis Topping_, killed at\\nthe taking of the rich _Portuguese_ Ship on the Coast of _Brasil; Walter\\nKennedy_, hanged at _Execution-Dock_, and two others, which I forbear to\\nname, because, I understand they are at this Day employ'd in an honest\\nVocation in the City.\\n\\nWhat followed concerning _Anstis_'s Pyracies, has been included in the two\\npreceeding Chapters; I shall only observe that the Combination of these six\\nMen abovementioned, was the Beginning of that Company, that afterwards\\nproved so formidable under Captain _Roberts_, from whom _Anstis_ separated\\nthe 18th of _April_ 1721, in the _Good Fortune_ Brigantine, leaving his\\nCommadore to pursue his Adventures upon the Coast of _Guiney_, whilst he\\nreturned to the _West-Indies_, upon the like Design.\\n\\nAbout the Middle of _June_, these Pyrates met with one Captain _Marston_,\\nbetween _Hispaniola_ and _Jamaica_, bound on a Voyage to _New-York_; from\\nwhom they took all the wearing Apparel they could find, as also his Liquors\\nand Provision, and five of his Men, but did not touch his Cargo; two or\\nthree other Vessels were also plundered by them, in this Cruise, out of\\nwhom they stocked themselves with Provision and Men; among the rest, I\\nthink, was the _Irwin_, Captain _Ross_, from _Cork_ in _Ireland_; but this\\nI won't be positive of, because they denied it themselves. This Ship had\\n600 Barrels of Beef aboard, besides other Provisions, and was taken off\\n_Martinico_, wherein Colonel _Doyly_ of _Montserrat_, and his Family were\\nPassengers. The Colonel was very much abused and wounded, for endeavouring\\nto save a poor Woman, that was also a Passenger, from the Insults of that\\nbrutish Crew; and the Pyrates prevailing, twenty one of them forced the\\npoor Creature successively, afterwards broke her Back and flung her into\\nthe Sea. I say, I will not be positive it was _Anstis_'s Crew that acted\\nthis unheard of Violence and Cruelty, tho' the Circumstances of the Place,\\nthe Time, the Force of the Vessel, and the Number of Men, do all concur,\\nand I can place the Villany no where else; but that such a Fact was done,\\nthere is too much Evidence for it to be doubted of.\\n\\nWhen they thought fit to put an End to this Cruize, they went into one of\\nthe Islands to clean, which they effected without any Disturbance, and came\\nout again, and stretching away towards _Burmudas_, met with a stout Ship,\\ncalled the _Morning Star_, bound from _Guiney_ to _Carolina_; they made\\nPrize of her, and kept her for their own Use. In a Day or two, a Ship from\\n_Barbadoes_ bound to _New-York_, fell into their Hands, and taking out her\\nGuns and Tackle, mounted the _Morning Star_ with 32 Pieces of Cannon,\\nmann'd her with a 100 Men, and appointed one _John Fenn_ Captain; for the\\nBrigantine being of far less Force, the _Morning Star_ would have fallen to\\n_Anstis_, as elder Officer, yet he was so in Love with his own Vessel, (she\\nbeing an excellent Sailor,) that he made it his Choice to stay in her, and\\nlet _Fenn_, who was, before, his Gunner, Command the great Ship.\\n\\nNow, that they had two good Ships well mann'd, it may be supposed they were\\nin a Condition to undertake something bold: But their Government was\\ndisturbed by Malecontents, and a Kingdom divided within it self cannot\\nstand; they had such a Number of new Men amongst them, that seem'd not so\\nviolently enclined for the Game; that whatever the Captain proposed, it was\\ncertainly carried against him, so that they came to no fix'd Resolution for\\nthe undertaking any Enterprize; therefore there was nothing to be done, but\\nto break up the Company, which seemed to be the Inclination of the\\nMajority, but the Manner of doing so, concerned their common Safety; to\\nwhich Purpose various Means were proposed, at length it was concluded to\\nsend home a Petition to his Majesty (there being then no Act of Indemnity\\nin Force) for a Pardon, and wait the Issue; at the same Time one _Jones_,\\nBoatswain of the _Good Fortune_, proposed a Place of safe Retreat, it being\\nan uninhabited Island near _Cuba_, which he had been used to in the late\\nWar, when he went a privateering against the _Spaniards._\\n\\nThis being approved of, it was unanimously resolved on, and the\\nunderwritten Petition drawn up and signed by the whole Company in the\\nManner of what they call a _Round Robin_, that is, the Names were writ in a\\nCircle, to avoid all Appearance of Pre-eminence, and least any Person\\nshould be mark'd out by the Government, as a principal Rogue among them.\\n\\n_To his most sacred Majesty_ George, _by the Grace of God, of_\\nGreat-Britain, France _and_ Ireland, _King, Defender of the Faith_, &c.\\n\\nThe humble PETITION of the Company, now belonging to the Ship\\n_Morning Star_, and Brigantine _Good Fortune_, lying under the ignominious\\nName and Denomination of PYRATES.\\n\\n      Humbly sheweth,\\n\\nT_HAT we your Majesty's most loyal Subjects, have, at sundry Times,\\nbeen taken by_ Bartholomew Roberts, _the then Captain of the abovesaid\\nVessels and Company, together with another Ship, in which we left him; and\\nhave been forced by him and his wicked Accomplices, to enter into, and\\nserve, in the said Company, as Pyrates, much contrary to our Wills and\\nInclinations: And we your loyal Subjects utterly abhoring and detesting\\nthat impious way of Living, did, with an unanimous Consent, and contrary to\\nthe Knowledge of the said_ Roberts, _or his Accomplices, on, or about the_\\n18_th Day of_ April 1721, _leave, and ran away with the aforesaid Ship_\\nMorning Star, _and Brigantine_ Good Fortune, _with no other Intent and\\nMeaning than the Hopes of obtaining your Majesty's most gracious Pardon.\\nAnd, that we your Majesty's most loyal Subjects, may with more Safety\\nreturn to our native Country, and serve the Nation, unto which we belong,\\nin our respective Capacities, without Fear of being prosecuted by the\\nInjured, whose Estates have suffered by the said_ Roberts _and his\\nAccomplices, during our forcible Detainment, by the said Company: We most\\nhumbly implore your Majesty's most royal Assent, to this our humble\\nPetition._\\n\\nAnd your Petitioners shall ever pray.\\n\\nThis Petition was sent home by a Merchant Ship bound to _England_, from\\n_Jamaica_, who promised to speak with the Petitioners, in their Return,\\nabout 20 Leagues to Windward of that Island, and let them know what Success\\ntheir Petition met with. When this was done, the Pyrates retires to the\\nIsland before proposed, with the Ship and Brigantine.\\n\\nThis Island (which I have no Name for) lies off the Southwest End of\\n_Cuba_, uninhabited, and little frequented. On the East End is a Lagune, so\\nnarrow, that a Ship can but just go in, tho' there's from 15 to 22 Foot\\nWater, for almost a League up: On both Sides of the Lagune grows red\\nMangrove Trees, very thick, that the Entrance of it, as well as the Vessels\\nlaying there, is hardly to be seen. In the Middle of the Island are here\\nand there a small thick Wood of tall Pines, and other Trees scattered about\\nin different Places.\\n\\nHere they staid about nine Months, but not having Provision for above two,\\nthey were forced to take what the Island afforded, which was Fish of\\nseveral Sorts, particularly Turtle, which latter was the chiefest Food they\\nlived on, and was found in great Plenty on the Coasts of this Island;\\nwhether there might be any wild Hogs, Beef, or other Cattle, common to\\nseveral Islands of the _West-Indies_, or that the Pyrates were too idle to\\nhunt them, or whether they preferr'd other Provisions to that sort of Diet,\\nI know not; but I was informed by them, that for the whole Time they eat\\nnot a Bit of any kind of Flesh-Meat, nor Bread; the latter was supply'd by\\nRice, of which they had a great Quantity aboard: This was boyl'd and\\nsqueez'd dry, and so eat with the Turtle.\\n\\nThere are three or four Sorts of these Creatures in the _West-Indies_, the\\nlargest of which will weight 150 or 200 Pound Weight or more, but those\\nthat were found upon this Island were of the smallest Kind, weighing 10 or\\n12 Pounds each, with a fine natural wrought Shell, and beautifully clouded;\\nthe Meat sweet and tender, some Part of it eating like Chicken, some like\\nVeal, _&c._ so that it was no extraordinary Hardship for them to live upon\\nthis Provision alone, since it affords variety of Meats to the Taste, of it\\nself. The manner of catching this Fish is very particular; you must\\nunderstand, that in the Months of _May, June_ and _July_, they lay their\\nEggs in order to hatch their Young, and this three times in a Season, which\\nis always in the Sand of the Sea-shore, each laying 80 or 90 Eggs at a\\ntime. The Male accompanies the Female, and come ashore in the Night only,\\nwhen they must be watch'd, without making any Noise, or having a Light; as\\nsoon as they land, the Men that watch for them, turn them on their Backs,\\nthen haul them above high Water Mark, and leave them till next Morning,\\nwhere they are sure to find them, for they can't turn again, nor move from\\nthe Place. It is to be observ'd, that besides their laying time, they come\\nashore to feed, but then what's very remarkable in these Creatures, they\\nalways resort to different Places to breed, leaving their usual Haunts for\\ntwo or three Months, and 'tis thought they eat nothing in all that Season.\\n\\nThey pass'd their Time here in Dancing, and other Diversions, agreeable to\\nthese sort of Folks; and among the rest, they appointed a Mock Court of\\nJudicature to try one another for Pyracy, and he that was a Criminal one\\nDay was made Judge another.-- I had an Account given me of one of these\\nmerry Tryals, and as it appeared diverting, I shall give the Readers a\\nshort Account of it.\\n\\nThe Court and Criminals being both appointed, as also Council to plead, the\\nJudge got up in a Tree, and had a dirty Taurpaulin hung over his Shoulders;\\nthis was done by Way of Robe, with a Thrum Cap on his Head, and a large\\nPair of Spectacles upon his Nose: Thus equipp'd, he settled himself in his\\nPlace, and abundance of Officers attending him below, with Crows,\\nHandspikes, _&c._ instead of Wands, Tipstaves, and such like.-- The\\nCriminals were brought out, making a thousand sour Faces; and one who acted\\nas Attorney-General opened the Charge against them; their Speeches were\\nvery laconick, and their whole Proceedings concise. We shall give it by Way\\nof Dialogue.\\n\\n_Attorn. Gen._ An't please your Lordship, and you Gentlemen of the Jury,\\nhere is a Fellow before you that is a sad Dog, a sad sad Dog; and I humbly\\nhope your Lordship will order him to be hang'd out of the Way\\nimmediately.--He has committed Pyracy upon the High Seas, and we shall\\nprove, an't please your Lordship, that this Fellow, this sad Dog before\\nyou, has escap'd a thousand Storms, nay, has got safe ashore when the Ship\\nhas been cast away, which was a certain Sign he was not born to be drown'd;\\nyet not having the Fear of hanging before his Eyes, he went on robbing and\\nravishing Man, Woman and Child, plundering Ships Cargoes fore and aft,\\nburning and sinking Ship, Bark and Boat, as if the Devil had been in him.\\nBut this is not all, my Lord, he has committed worse Villanies than all\\nthese, for we shall prove, that he has been guilty of drinking Small-Beer;\\nand your Lordship knows, there never was a sober Fellow but what was a\\nRogue.--My Lord, I should have spoke much finer than I do now, but that, as\\nyour Lordship knows our Rum is all out, and how should a Man speak good Law\\nthat has not drank a Dram.--However, I hope, your Lordship will order the\\nFellow to be hang'd.\\n\\n_Judge._--Hearkee me, Sirrah,--you lousy, pittiful, ill-look'd Dog; what\\nhave you to say why you should not be tuck'd up immediately, and set a\\nSun-drying like a Scare-crow?--Are you guilty, or not guilty?\\n\\n_Pris._ Not guilty, an't please your Worship.\\n\\n_Judge._ Not guilty! say so again, Sirrah, and I'll have you hang'd without\\nany Tryal.\\n\\n_Pris._ An't please your Worship's Honour, my Lord, I am as honest a poor\\nFellow as ever went between Stem and Stern of a Ship, and can hand, reef,\\nsteer, and clap two Ends of a Rope together, as well as e'er a He that ever\\ncross'd salt Water; but I was taken by one _George Bradley_ [the Name of\\nhim that sat as Judge,] a notorious Pyrate, a sad Rogue as ever was\\nunhang'd, and he forc'd me, an't please your Honour.\\n\\n_Judge._ Answer me, Sirrah,--How will you be try'd?\\n\\n_Pris._ By G-- and my Country.\\n\\n_Judge._ The Devil you will.--Why then, Gentlemen of the Jury, I think we\\nhave nothing to do but to proceed to Judgment.\\n\\n_Attor. Gen._ Right, my Lord; for if the Fellow should be suffer'd to\\nspeak, he may clear himself, and that's an Affront to the Court.\\n\\n_Pris._ Pray, my Lord, I hope your Lordship will consider--\\n\\n_Judge._ Consider!--How dare you talk of considering? --Sirrah, Sirrah, I\\nnever consider'd in all my Life. --I'll make it Treason to consider.\\n\\n_Pris._ But, I hope, your Lordship will hear some Reason.\\n\\n_Judge._ D'ye hear how the Scoundrel prates?--What have we to do with\\nReason?--I'd have you to know, Raskal, we don't sit here to hear\\nReason;--we go according to Law.--Is our Dinner ready?\\n\\n_Attor. Gen._ Yes, my Lord.\\n\\n_Judge._ Then heark'ee, you Raskal at the Bar; hear me, Sirrah, hear\\nme.--You must suffer, for three Reasons; first, because it is not fit I\\nshould sit here as Judge, and no Body be hang'd.--Secondly, you must be\\nhang'd, because you have a damn'd hanging Look:--And thirdly, you must be\\nhang'd, because I am hungry; for know, Sirrah, that 'tis a Custom, that\\nwhenever the Judge's Dinner is ready before the Tryal is over, the Prisoner\\nis to be hang'd of Course.--There's Law for you, ye Dog.--So take him away\\nGoaler.\\n\\n                                * * *\\n\\nThis is the Tryal just as it was related to me; the Design of my setting it\\ndown, is only to shew how these Fellows can jest upon Things, the Fear and\\nDread of which, should make them tremble.\\n\\nThe beginning of _August_ 1722, the Pyrates made ready the Brigantine, and\\ncame out to Sea, and beating up to Windward, lay in the Track for their\\nCorrespondant in her Voyage to _Jamaica_, and spoke with her; but finding\\nnothing was done in _England_ in their Favour, as 'twas expected, they\\nreturn'd to their Consorts at the Island with the ill News, and found\\nthemselves under a Necessity, as they fancied, to continue that abominable\\nCourse of Life they had lately practis'd; in order thereto, they sail'd\\nwith the Ship and Brigantine to the Southward, and the next Night, by\\nintolerable Neglect, they run the _Morning Star_ upon the _Grand Caimanes_,\\nand wreck'd her; the Brigantine seeing the Fate of her Consort, hall'd off\\nin Time, and so weather'd the Island. The next Day Captain _Anstis_ put in,\\nand found that all, or the greatest part of the Crew, were safe ashore,\\nwhereupon she came to an Anchor, in order to fetch them off; and having\\nbrought _Fenn_ the Captain, _Philips_ the Carpenter, and a few others\\naboard, two Men of War came down upon them, _viz._ the _Hector_ and\\n_Adventure_, so that the Brigantine had but just Time to cut their Cable,\\nand get to Sea, with one of the Men of War after her, keeping within\\nGun-shot for several Hours. _Anstis_ and his Crew were now under the\\ngreatest Consternation imaginable, finding the Gale freshen, and the Man of\\nWar gaining Ground upon them, so that, in all Probability, they must have\\nbeen Prisoners in two Hours more; but it pleased God to give them a little\\nlonger Time, the Wind dying away, the Pyrates got out their Oars, and row'd\\nfor their Lives, and thereby got clear of their Enemy.\\n\\nThe _Hector_ landed her Men upon the Island, and took 40 of the _Morning\\nStar_'s Crew, without any Resistance made by them; but on the contrary,\\nalledging, they were forc'd Men, and that they were glad of this\\nOpportunity to escape from the Pyrates; the rest hid themselves in the\\nWoods, and could not be found. _George Bradley_ the Master, and three more,\\nsurrender'd afterwards to a _Burmudas_ Sloop, and were carried to that\\nIsland.\\n\\nThe Brigantine, after her Escape, sail'd to a small Island near the Bay of\\n_Honduras_, to clean and refit, and, in her Way thither, took a _Rhode\\nIsland_ Sloop, Captain _Durfey_, Commander, and two or three other Vessels,\\nwhich they destroy'd, but brought all the Hands aboard their own.\\n\\nWhile she was cleaning, a Scheme was concerted between Captain _Durfey_,\\nsome other Prisoners, and two or three of the Pyrates, for to seize some of\\nthe Chiefs, and carry off the Brigantine; but the same being discovered\\nbefore she was fit for sailing, their Design was prevented: However,\\nCaptain _Durfey_, and four or five more, got ashore with some Arms and\\nAmmunition; and when the Pyrates Canoe came in for Water, he seiz'd the\\nBoat with the Men; upon which _Anstis_ ordered another Boat to be mann'd\\nwith 30 Hands and sent ashore, which was accordingly done; but Captain\\n_Durfey_, and the Company he had by that Time got together, gave them such\\na warm Reception, that they were contented to betake themselves to their\\nVessel again.\\n\\nAbout the beginning of _December_, 1722, _Anstis_ left this Place and\\nreturn'd to the Islands, designing to accumulate all the Power and Strength\\nhe could, since there was no looking back. He took in the Cruise a good\\nShip, commanded by Captain _Smith_, which he mounted with 24 Guns, and\\n_Fenn_, a one handed Man, who commanded the _Morning-Star_ when she was\\nlost, went aboard to command her. They cruis'd together, and took a Vessel\\nor two, and then went to the _Bahama Islands_, and there met with what they\\nwanted, _viz._ a Sloop loaded with Provisions, from _Dublin_, called the\\n_Antelope._\\n\\nIt was time now to think of some Place to fit up and clean their Frigate\\nlately taken, and put her in a Condition to do Business; accordingly they\\npitch'd upon the Island of _Tobago_, where they arrived the beginning of\\n_April_, 1723, with the _Antelope_ Sloop and her Cargo.\\n\\nThey fell to work immediately, got the Guns, Stores, and every Thing else\\nout upon the Island, and put the Ship upon the Heel; and just then, as ill\\nLuck would have it, came in the _Winchelsea_ Man of War, by Way of Visit,\\nwhich put the Marooners into such a Surprize, that they set Fire to the\\nShip and Sloop, and fled ashore to the Woods. _Anstis_, in the Brigantine,\\nescap'd, by having a light Pair of Heels, but it put his Company into such\\na Disorder, that their Government could never be set to rights again; for\\nsome of the New-Comers, and those who had been tir'd with the Trade, put an\\nEnd to the Reign, by shooting _Tho. Anstis_ in his Hammock, and afterwards\\nthe Quarter-Master, and two or three others; the rest submitting, they put\\ninto Irons, and surrender'd them up, and the Vessel, at _Curacco_, a\\n_Dutch_ Settlement, where they were try'd and hang'd; and those concerned\\nin delivering up the Vessel, acquitted.\\n\\nBut to return to Captain _Fenn_, he was taken stragling with his Gunner and\\nthree more, a Day or two after their Misfortune, by the Man of War's Men,\\nand carry'd to _Antegoa_, where they were all executed, and _Fenn_ hang'd\\nin Chains. Those who remain'd, staid some Time in the Island, keeping up\\nand down in the Woods, with a Hand to look out; at length Providence so\\norder'd it, that a small Sloop came into the Harbour, which they all got\\naboard of, except two or three Negroes, and those they left behind. They\\ndid not think fit to pursue any further Adventures, and therefore\\nunanimously resolved to steer for _England_, which they accordingly did,\\nand in _October_ last came into _Bristol_ Channel, sunk the Sloop, and\\ngetting ashore in the Boat, dispersed themselves to their Abodes.\\n\\nCHAP. XI. OF Captain _WORLEY_, And his CREW.\\n\\nHIS Reign was but short, but his Beginning somewhat particular,\\nsetting out in a small open Boat, with eight others, from _New-York._ This\\nwas as resolute a Crew as ever went upon this Account: They took with them\\na few Biscuits, and a dry'd Tongue or two, a little Cag of Water, half a\\ndozen old Muskets and Ammunition accordingly. Thus provided, they left\\n_New-York_ the latter End of _September_ 1718, but it cannot be supposed\\nthat such a Man of War as this, could undertake any considerable Voyage, or\\nattempt any extraordinary Enterprize; so they stood down the Coast, till\\nthey came to _Delaware_ River, which is about 150 Miles distant, and not\\nmeeting with any Thing in their Way, they turn'd up the same River as high\\nas _Newcastle_, near which Place they fell upon a Shallop belonging to\\n_George Grant_, who was bringing Houshold Goods, Plate, _&c._ from\\n_Oppoquenimi_ to _Philadelphia_; they made Prize of the most valuable Part\\nof them, and let the Shallop go. This Fact could not come under the Article\\nof Pyracy, it not being committed _super altum Mare_, upon the High-Sea,\\ntherefore was a simple Robbery only; but they did not stand for a Point of\\nLaw in the Case, but easing the Shallop Man of his Lading, the bold\\nAdventurers went down the River again.\\n\\nThe Shallop came straight to _Philadelphia_, and brought the ill News\\nthither, which so alarm'd the Government, as if War had been declared\\nagainst them; Expresses were sent to _New-York_, and other Places, and\\nseveral Vessels fitted out against this powerful Rover, but to no manner of\\nPurpose; for after several Days Cruize, they all return'd, without so much\\nas hearing what became of the Robbers.\\n\\n_Worley_ and his Crew, in going down the River, met with a Sloop of\\n_Philadelphia_, belonging to a Mulatto, whom they call'd _Black Robbin_;\\nthey quitted their Boat for this Sloop, taking one of _Black Robin_'s Men\\nalong with them, as they had also done from _George Grant_, besides two\\nNegroes, which encreased the Company one Third. A Day or two after, they\\ntook another Sloop belonging to _Hull_, homeward bound, which was somewhat\\nfitter for their Purpose; they found aboard her, Provisions and\\nNecessaries, which they stood in need of, and enabled them to prosecute\\ntheir Design, in a manner more suitable to their Wishes.\\n\\nUpon the Success of these Rovers, the Governor issued out a Proclamation,\\nfor the apprehending and taking all Pyrates, who had refused or neglected\\nto surrender themselves, by the Time limited in his Majesty's Proclamation\\nof Pardon; and thereupon, ordered his Majesty's Ship _Phoenix_, of 20 Guns,\\nwhich lay at _Sandy Hook_, to Sea, to cruize upon this Pyrate, and secure\\nthe Trade to that, and the adjoining Colonies.\\n\\nIn all probability, the taking this Sloop sav'd their Bacons, for this\\nTime, tho' they fell into the Trap presently afterwards; for they finding\\nthemselves in tolerable good Condition, having a Vessel newly cleaned, with\\nProvisions, _&c._ they stood off to Sea, and so missed the _Phoenix_, who\\nexpected them to be still on the Coast.\\n\\nAbout six Weeks afterwards they returned, having taken both a Sloop and a\\nBrigantine, among the _Bahama_ Islands; the former they sunk, and the other\\nthey let go: The Sloop belonged to _New-York_, and they thought the sinking\\nof her good Policy, to prevent her returning to tell Tales at Home.\\n\\n_Worley_ had by this Time encreased his Company to about five and twenty\\nMen, had six Guns mounted, and small Arms as many as were necessary for\\nthem, and seem'd to be in a good thriving sort of a Way. He made a black\\nEnsign, with a white Death's Head in the Middle of it, and other Colours\\nsuitable to it. They all signed Articles, and bound themselves under a\\nsolemn Oath, to take no Quarters, but to stand by one another to the last\\nMan, which was rashly fulfill'd a little afterwards.\\n\\nFor going into an Inlet in _North-Carolina_, to clean, the Governor\\nreceived Information of it, and fitted out two Sloops, one of eight Guns,\\nand the other with six, and about seventy Men between them. _Worley_ had\\nclean'd his Sloop, and sail'd before the _Carolina_ Sloops reached the\\nPlace, and steered to the Northward; but the Sloops just mentioned,\\npursuing the same Course, came in sight of _Worley_, as he was cruising off\\nthe Capes of _Virginia_, and being in the Offin, he stood in as soon as he\\nsaw the Sloops, intending thereby to have cut them off from _James_ River;\\nfor he verily believed they had been bound thither, not imagining, in the\\nleast, they were in Pursuit of him.\\n\\nThe two Sloops standing towards the Capes at the same Time, and _Worley_\\nhoisting of his black Flag, the Inhabitants of _James_ Town were in the\\nutmost Consternation, thinking that all three had been Pyrates, and that\\ntheir Design had been upon them; so that all the Ships and Vessels that\\nwere in the Road, or in the Rivers up the Bay, had Orders immediately to\\nhale in to the Shore, for their Security, or else to prepare for their\\nDefence, if they thought themselves in a Condition to fight. Soon after two\\nBoats, which were sent out to get Intelligence, came crowding in, and\\nbrought an Account, that one of the Pyrates was in the Bay, being a small\\nSloop of six Guns. The Governor expecting the rest would have followed, and\\naltogether make some Attempt to land, for the sake of Plunder, beat to\\nArms, and collected all the Force that could be got together, to oppose\\nthem; he ordered all the Guns out of the Ships, to make a Platform, and, in\\nshort, put the whole Colony in a warlike Posture; but was very much\\nsurprised at last, to see all the supposed Pyrates fighting with one\\nanother.\\n\\nThe Truth of the Matter is, _Worley_ gained the Bay, thinking to make sure\\nof his two Prizes, by keeping them from coming in; but by the hoisting of\\nthe King's Colours, and firing a Gun, he quickly was sensible of his\\nMistake, and too soon perceived that the Tables were turned upon him; that\\ninstead of keeping them out, he found himself, by a superiour Force kept\\nin. When the Pyrates saw how Things went, they resolutely prepar'd\\nthemselves for a desperate Defence; and tho' three to one odds, _Worley_\\nand his Crew determined to fight to the last Gasp, and receive no Quarters,\\nagreeably to what they had before sworn; so that they must either Dye or\\nConquer upon the Spot.\\n\\nThe _Carolina_ Men gave the Pyrate a Broadside, and then Boarded him, one\\nSloop getting upon his Quarter, and the other on his Bow; _Worley_ and the\\nCrew, drew up upon the Deck, and fought very obstinately, Hand to Hand, so\\nthat in a few Minutes, abundance of Men lay weltering in their Gore; the\\nPyrates proved as good as their Words, not a Man of them cry'd out for\\nQuarter, nor would accept of such, when offered, but were all killed except\\nthe Captain and another Man, and those very much wounded, whom they\\nreserved for the Gallows. They were brought ashore in Irons, and the next\\nDay, which was the 17th of _February_ 1718-19, they were both hanged up,\\nfor fear they should dye, and evade the Punishment as was thought due to\\ntheir Crimes.\\n\\nCHAP. XII. OF Capt. _George Lowther_, And his CREW.\\n\\nG_Eorge Lowther_ sailed out of the River of _Thames_, in one of the\\nRoyal _African_ Company's Ships, call'd the _Gambia Castle_, of 16 Guns and\\n30 Men, _Charles Russel_ Commander; of which Ship, the said _Lowther_ was\\nsecond Mate. Aboard of the same Ship, was a certain Number of Soldiers,\\ncommanded by one _John Massey_, who were to be carried to one of the\\nCompany's Settlements, on the River of _Gambia_, to Garrison a Fort, which\\nwas sometime ago taken and destroy'd by Captain _Davis_ the Pyrate.\\n\\nIn _May_ 1721, the _Gambia Castle_ came safe to her Port in _Africa_, and\\nlanded Captain _Massey_ and his Men on _James_'s Island, where he was to\\nCommand under the Governor, Colonel _Whitney_, who arrived there at the\\nsame Time, in another Ship: And here, by a fatal Misunderstanding, between\\nthe military Folks and the Trading People, the Fort and Garrison not only\\ncame to be lost again to the Company, but a fine Galley well provided, and\\nworth 10000 _l._ turned against her Masters.\\n\\nThe Names of Governor and Captain sounded great, but when the Gentlemen\\nfound that the Power that generally goes along with those Titles, was\\noversway'd and born down by the Merchants and Factors, (mechanick Fellows\\nas they thought them) they grew very impatient and disatisfy'd, especially\\n_Massey_, who was very loud in his Complaints against them, particularly at\\nthe small Allowance of Provisions to him and his Men; for the Garrison and\\nGovernor too, were victualled by the Merchants, which was no small\\nGrievance and Mortification to them. And as the want of eating was the only\\nThing that made the great _Sancho_ quit his Government, so did it here rend\\nand tare their's to Pieces: For _Massey_ told them, _that he did not come\\nthere to be a_ Guiney _Slave, and that he had promised his Men good\\nTreatment, and Provisions fitting for Soldiers: That as he had the Care of\\nso many of his Majesty's Subjects, if they would not provide for them in a\\nhandsome Manner, he should take suitable Measures for the Preservation of\\nso many of his Countrymen and Companions._\\n\\nThe Governor at this Time was very ill of a Fever, and, for the better\\nAccomodation in his Sickness, was carried aboard the Ship _Gambia Castle_,\\nwhere he continued for about three Weeks, and therefore could have little\\nto say in this Dispute, tho' he resolved not to stay in a Place, where\\nthere was so little Occasion for him, and where his Power was so confin'd.\\nThe Merchants had certainly Orders from the Company, to issue the\\nProvisions out to the Garrison, and the same is done along the whole Coast;\\nbut whether they had cut them short of the Allowance that was appointed\\nthem, I can't say, but if they did, then is the Loss of the Ship and\\nGarrison owing principally to their ill Conduct.\\n\\nHowever, an Accident that happened on Board the Ship, did not a little\\ncontribute to this Misfortune, which was a Pique that the Captain of her\\ntook against his second Mate, _George Lowther_, the Man who is the Subject\\nof this short History; and who losing his Favour, found Means to ingratiate\\nhimself into the good liking of the common Sailors, insomuch that when\\nCaptain _Russel_ ordered him to be punish'd, the Men took up Handspikes,\\nand threat'ned to knock that Man down, that offered to lay hold of the\\nMate. This served but to widen the Differences between him and the Captain,\\nand more firmly attach'd _Lowther_ to the Ship's Company, the greatest Part\\nof which, he found ripe for any Mischief in the World.\\n\\nCaptain _Massey_ was no wit the better reconciled to the Place, by a longer\\nContinuance, nor to the Usage he met with there, and having often\\nOpportunities of conversing with _Lowther_, with whom he had contracted an\\nIntimacy in the Voyage; they aggravated one another's Grievances to such a\\nheight, that they resolved upon Measures to curb the Power that controul'd\\nthem, and to provide for themselves after another Manner.\\n\\nWhen the Governor recover'd of his Fever, he went ashore to the Island, but\\ntook no Notice of _Massey_'s Behaviour, tho' it was such as might give\\nSuspicion of what he designed; and _Lowther_, and the common Sailors, who\\nwere in the Secret of Affairs, grew insolent and bold, even refusing to\\nobey when commanded to their Duty by Captain _Russel_ and the chief Mate.\\nThe Captain seeing how Things were carried, goes ashore early one Morning\\nto the Governor and Factory, in order to hold a Council, which _Lowther_\\napprehending, was in order to prevent his Design, sent a Letter in the same\\nBoat to _Massey_, intimating it to him, and _that he should repair on\\nBoard, for it was high Time to put their Project in Execution._\\n\\nAs soon as _Massey_ received this Letter, he went to the Soldiers at the\\n_Barracks_, and said to them, and others, _You that have a Mind to go to_\\nEngland, _now is your Time_; and they generally consenting, _Massey_ went\\nto the Store-Room, burst open the Door, set two Centinels upon it, and\\nordered that no Body should come near it; then he went to the Governor's\\nApartment, and took his Bed, Baggage, Plate and Furniture, (in Expectation\\nthat the Governor himself, as he had promised _Massey_, would have gone on\\nBoard, which he afterwards refused, by Reason, as he said, he believed they\\nwere going a-pyrating; which at first, whatever _Lowther_ designed,\\n_Massey_ certainly proposed only the going to _England_;) when this was\\ndone, he sent the Boat off to the chief Mate, with this Message, _That he\\nshould get the Guns ready, for that the King of_ Barro [a Negro Kingdom\\nnear the Royal _African_ Settlement] _would come aboard to Dinner._ But\\n_Lowther_ understanding best, the meaning of those Orders, he confined the\\nchief Mate, shotted the Guns, and put the Ship in a Condition for sailing.\\nIn the Afternoon _Massey_ came on Board with the Governor's Son, having\\nsent off all the Provisions of the Island, and eleven Pipes of Wine,\\nleaving only two half Pipes behind in the Store-House, and dismounted all\\nthe Guns of the Fort.\\n\\nIn the Afternoon they weigh'd one Anchor, but fearing to be too late to get\\nout of the River, they slipp'd the other, and so fell down; in doing of\\nwhich, they run the Ship a-ground. _Massey_ shew'd himself a Soldier upon\\nthis Accident, for as soon as the Misfortune happen'd, he left the Ship\\nwith about sixteen Hands, and rows directly to the Fort, remounts the Guns,\\nand keeps Garrison there all the Night, while the Ship was ashore; and\\nobliged some of the Factory to assist in getting her clear. In the mean\\nwhile, _Russel_ came off, but not being suffered to come on Board, he\\ncall'd to _Lowther_, and offered him and the Company, whatever Terms they\\nwould be pleased to accept of, upon Condition of surrendering up the Ship,\\nwhich had no Effect upon any of them. In the Morning they got her afloat,\\nand _Massey_ and his Men came aboard, after having nailed up and dismounted\\nall the Cannon of the Fort: They put the Governor's Son, and two or three\\nothers ashore, who were not willing to go without the Governor, and sail'd\\nout of the River, having exchanged several Shot with the _Martha, Otter,\\n&c._ that lay there, without doing Execution on either Side.\\n\\nWhen the Ship came out to Sea, _Lowther_ called up all the Company, and\\ntold them, _it was the greatest Folly imaginable, to think of returning to_\\nEngland, _for what they had already done, could not be justifyed upon any\\nPretence whatsoever, but would be look'd upon, in the Eye of the Law, a\\ncapital Offence, and that none of them were in a Condition to withstand the\\nAttacks of such powerful Adversaries, as they would meet with at Home; for\\nhis Part he was determined not to run such a Hazard, and therefore if his\\nProposal was not agreed to, he desired to be set a Shore in some Place of\\nSafety: That they had a good Ship under them, a parcel of brave Follows in\\nher, that it was not their Business to starve, or be made Slaves; and\\ntherefore, if they were all of his Mind, they should seek their Fortunes\\nupon the Seas, as other Adventurers had done before them._ They one and all\\ncame into the Measures, knocked down the Cabins, made the Ship flush fore\\nand aft, prepared black Colours, new named her, _the Delivery_, having\\nabout 50 Hands and 16 Guns, and the following short Articles were drawn up,\\nsigned and sworn to upon the Bible.\\n\\nThe Articles of Captain _George Lowther_, and his Company.\\n\\n1. _THE Captain is to have two full Shares; the Master is to have one Share\\nand a half; the Doctor, Mate, Gunner, and Boatswain, one Share and a\\nquarter._\\n\\n2. _He that shall be found Guilty of taking up any unlawful Weapon on Board\\nthe Privateer, or any Prize, by us taken, so as to strike or abuse one\\nanother, in any regard, shall suffer what Punishment the Captain and\\nMajority of the Company shall think fit._\\n\\n3. _He that shall be found Guilty of Cowardize, in the Time of Engagement,\\nshall suffer what Punishment the Captain and Majority shall think fit._\\n\\n4. _If any Gold, Jewels, Silver_, &c. _be found on Board of any Prize or\\nPrizes, to the Value of a Piece of Eight, and the Finder do not deliver it\\nto the Quarter-Master, in the Space of_ 24 _Hours, shall suffer what\\nPunishment the Captain and Majority shall think fit._\\n\\n5. _He that is found Guilty of Gaming, or Defrauding another to the Value\\nof a Shilling, shall suffer what Punishment the Captain and Majority of the\\nCompany shall think fit._\\n\\n6. _He that shall have the Misfortune to lose a Limb, in Time of\\nEngagement, shall have the Sum of one hundred and fifty Pounds Sterling,\\nand remain with the Company as long as he shall think fit._\\n\\n7. _Good Quarters to be given when call'd for._\\n\\n8. _He that sees a Sail first, shall have the best Pistol, or Small-Arm, on\\nBoard her._\\n\\nIt was the 13th of _June_, that _Lowther_ left the Settlement, and on the\\n20th, being then within twenty Leagues of _Barbadoes_, he came up with a\\nBrigantine, belonging to _Boston_, called the _Charles, James Douglass_\\nMaster, which they plundered in a pyratical Manner, and let the Vessel go;\\nbut least she should meet with any of the Station Ships, and so give\\nInformation of the Robbery, _in Terrorem_, to prevent a Pursuit, _Lowther_\\ncontrived a sort of a Certificate, which he directed the Master to shew to\\ntheir Consort, if they should meet with her; and upon Sight of it the\\nBrigantine would pass unmolested: This Consort, he pretended, was a 40 Gun\\nShip, and cruising therabouts.\\n\\nAfter this the _Delivery_ proceeded to _Hispaniola_; near the West End of\\nthe Island she met with a _French_ Sloop loaden with Wine and Brandy;\\naboard of this Vessel went Captain _Massey_, as a Merchant, and ask'd the\\nPrice of one Thing, and then another, bidding Money for the greatest Part\\nof the Cargo; but after he had trifled a while, he whisper'd a Secret in\\nthe _French_ Man's Ear, _viz. That they must have it all without Money.\\nMonsieur_ presently understood his Meaning, and unwillingly agreed to the\\nBargain. They took out of her thirty Casks of Brandy, five Hogsheads of\\nWine, several Pieces of Chintzes, and other valuable Goods, and about 70\\n_l. English_, in Money; of which _Lowther_ generously return'd five Pounds\\nback to the _French_ Master for his Civilities.\\n\\nBut as all Constitutions grow old, and thereby shake and totter, so did our\\nCommonwealth in about a Month of its Age, feel Commotions and intestine\\nDisturbances, by the Divisions of its Members, which had near hand\\nterminated in its Destruction; these civil Discords were owing to the\\nfollowing Occasion. Captain _Massey_ had been a Soldier almost from his\\nInfancy, but was but very indifferently acquainted with Maritime Affairs,\\nand having an enterprizing Soul, nothing would satisfy him, but he must be\\ndoing Business in his own Way, therefore he required _Lowther_ to let him\\nhave thirty Hands to land with, and he would attack the _French_\\nSettlements, and bring aboard the Devil and all of Plunder.\\n\\n_Lowther_ did all that he could do, and said all that he could say, to\\ndisswade _Massey_ from so rash and dangerous an Attempt; pointing out to\\nhim the Hazard the Company would run, and the Consequences to them all, if\\nhe should not succeed, and the little Likelihood there was to expect\\nSuccess from the Undertaking: But 'twas all one for that, _Massey_ would go\\nand attack the _French_ Settlements, for any thing _Lowther_ could say\\nagainst it; so that he was obliged to propose the Matter to the Company,\\namong whom _Massey_ found a few Fellows as resolute as himself; however, a\\ngreat Majority being against it, the Affair was over-ruled in Opposition to\\nCaptain _Massey_, notwithstanding which, _Massey_ grew fractious,\\nquarrelled with _Lowther_, and the Men divided into Parties, some siding\\nwith the Land Pyrate, and some with the Sea Rover, and were all ready to\\nfall together by the Ears, when the Man at the Mast-head cry'd out, A Sail!\\nA Sail! then they gave over the Dispute, set all their Sails, and steered\\nafter the Chace. In a few Hours they came up with her, she being a small\\nShip from _Jamaica_, bound to _England_; they took what they thought fit\\nout of her, and a Hand or two, and then _Lowther_ was for sinking the Ship,\\nwith several Passengers that were in her, for what Reason I know not, but\\n_Massey_ so that he interposed, prevented their cruel Fate, and the Ship\\nsafely arrived afterwards in _England._\\n\\nThe next Day they took a small Sloop, an interloping Trader, which they\\ndetain'd with her Cargo. All this while _Massey_ was uneasy, and declar'd\\nhis Resolution to leave them, and _Lowther_ finding him a very troublesome\\nMan to deal with, consented that he should take the Sloop, last made Prize\\nof, with what Hands had a Mind to go with him, and shift for himself.\\nWhereupon _Massey_, with about ten more Malecontents, goes aboard the\\nSloop, and comes away in her directly for _Jamaica._\\n\\nNotwithstanding what had passed, Captain _Massey_ puts a bold Face upon the\\nMatter, and goes to Sir _Nicholas Laws_, the Governor, informs him of his\\nleaving _Lowther_ the Pyrate, owns, _That he assisted in going off with the\\nShip, at the River_ Gambia; but said, _'twas to save so many of his\\nMajesty's Subjects from perishing, and that his Design was to return to_\\nEngland; _but_ Lowther _conspiring with the greater Part of the Company,\\nwent a pyrating with the Ship; and that he had taken this Opportunity to\\nleave him, and surrender himself and Vessel to his Excellency._\\n\\n_Massey_ was very well received by the Governor, and had his Liberty given\\nhim, with a Promise of his Favour, and so forth; and, at his own Request,\\nhe was sent on Board the _Happy_ Sloop, Captain _Laws_, to cruise off\\n_Hispaniola_, for _Lowther_; but not being so fortunate as to meet with\\nhim, Captain _Massey_ returned back to _Jamaica_ in the Sloop, and getting\\na Certificate, and a Supply of Money, from the Governor, he came home\\nPassenger to _England._\\n\\nWhen _Massey_ came to Town, he writes a long Letter to the Deputy Governor\\nand Directors of the _African_ Company, wherein he imprudently relates the\\nwhole Transactions of his Voyage, the going off with the Ship, and the Acts\\nof Pyracy he had committed with _Lowther_; but excuses it as Rashness and\\nInadvertency in himself, occasioned by his being ill used, contrary to the\\nPromises that had been made him, and the Expectations he had entertained;\\nbut own'd, that he deserved to dye for what he had done; yet, if they had\\nGenerosity enough to forgive him, as he was still capable to do them\\nService, as a Soldier, so he should be very ready to do it; but if they\\nresolved to prosecute him, he begg'd only this Favour, that he might not be\\nhang'd like a Dog, but to die like a Soldier, as he had been bred from his\\nChildhood, that is, that he might be shot.\\n\\nThis was the Substance of the Letter, which, however, did not produce so\\nfavourable an Answer as he hoped for, Word being brought back to him, _That\\nhe should be fairly hang'd._ Whereupon, _Massey_ resolved not to be out of\\nthe Way, when he found what important Occasion there was likely to be for\\nhim, but takes a Lodging in _Aldersgate-Street_, the next Day went to the\\nLord Chief Justice's Chambers, and enquired, if my Lord had granted a\\nWarrant against Captain _John Massey_, for Pyracy: But being told by the\\nClerks, that they knew of no such Thing; he informed them, he was the Man,\\nthat my Lord would soon be apply'd to for that Purpose, and the Officer\\nmight come to him at such a Place, where he lodg'd: They took the\\nDirections in Writing, and, in a few Days, a Warrant being issued, the\\nTipstaff went directly, by his own Information, and apprehended him,\\nwithout any other Trouble, than walking to his Lodging.\\n\\nThere was then no Person in Town to charge him with any Fact, upon which he\\ncould be committed; nor could the Letter be proved to be of his\\nHand-Writing, so that they had been obliged to let him go again, if he had\\nnot helped his Accusers out at Pinch: The Magistrate was reduced to the\\nputting of this Question to him, _Did you write this Letter?_ He answered,\\n_He did_: And not only that, but confessed all the Contents of it; upon\\nwhich, he was committed to _Newgate_, but was afterwards admitted to a\\nhundred Pounds Bail, or thereabouts.\\n\\nOn the 5th of _July_ 1723, he was brought to his Tryal, at a Court of\\nAdmiralty held at the _Old-Baily_, when Captain _Russel_, Governor\\n_Whitney_'s Son, and others, appeared as Evidences, by whom the Indictment\\nwas plainly proved against him; which, if it had not been done, the Captain\\nwas of such an heroick Spirit, that he would have deny'd nothing; for\\ninstead of making a Defence, he only entertained the Court with a long\\nNarrative of his Expedition, from the first setting out, to his Return to\\n_England_, mentioning two Acts of Pyracy committed by him, which he was not\\ncharged with, often challenging the Evidences to contradict him, if in any\\nThing he related the least Syllable of an Untruth; and instead of denying\\nthe Crimes set forth in the Indictment, he charged himself with various\\nCircumstances, which fixed the Facts more home upon him. Upon the whole,\\nthe Captain was found Guilty, received Sentence of Death, and was executed\\nthree Weeks after, at _Execution-Dock._\\n\\nWe return now to _Lowther_, whom we left cruising off _Hispaniola_, from\\nwhence he plyed to Windward, and, near _Porto Rico_, chased two Sail, and\\nspoke with them; they proving to be a small _Bristol_ Ship, commanded by\\nCaptain _Smith_, and a _Spanish_ Pyrate, who had made Prize of the said\\nShip. _Lowther_ examined into the _Spaniard_'s Authority for taking an\\n_English_ Vessel, and threat'ned to put every Man of them to death, for so\\ndoing; so that the _Spaniards_ fancied themselves to be in a very pittiful\\nCondition, till Matters cleared up, and they found their Masters as great\\nRogues as themselves, from whom some Mercy might be expected, in regard to\\nthe near Relation they stood with them, as to their Profession; in short,\\n_Lowther_ first rifled, and then burnt both the Ships, sending the\\n_Spaniards_ away in their Launch, and turning all the _English_ Sailors\\ninto Pyrates.\\n\\nAfter a few Days Cruise, _Lowther_ took a small Sloop belonging to St.\\n_Christophers_, which they mann'd and carried along with them to a small\\nIsland, where they cleaned, and stay'd some Time to take their Diversions,\\nwhich consisted in unheard of Debaucheries, with drinking, swearing and\\nrioting, in which there seemed to be a kind of Emulation among them,\\nresembling rather Devils than Men, striving who should out do one another\\nin new invented Oaths and Execrations.\\n\\nThey all got aboard about _Christmas_, observing neither Times nor Seasons,\\nfor perpetrating their villainous Actions, and sailed towards the Bay of\\n_Honduras_; but stopping at the _Grand Caimanes_ for Water, they met with a\\nsmall Vessel with 13 Hands, in the same honourable Employment with\\nthemselves; the Captain of this Gang was one _Edward Lowe_, whom we shall\\nparticularly discourse of in a Chapter by it self: _Lowther_ received them\\nas Friends, and treated them with all imaginable Respect, inviting them, as\\nthey were few in Number, and in no Condition to pursue the Account, (as\\nthey called it) to join their Strength together, which on the Consideration\\naforesaid, was accepted of, _Lowther_ still continuing Commander, and\\n_Lowe_ was made Lieutenant: The Vessel the new Pyrates came out of, they\\nsunk, and the Confederates proceed on the Voyage as _Lowther_ before\\nintended.\\n\\nThe 10th of _January_, the Pyrates came into the Bay, and fell upon a Ship\\nof 200 Tun, called the _Greyhound, Benjamin Edwards_ Commander, belonging\\nto _Boston. Lowther_ hoisted his pyratical Colours, and fired a Gun for the\\n_Greyhound_ to bring to, which she refusing, the _Happy Delivery_ (the Name\\nof the Pyrate) edg'd down, and gave her a Broadside, which was returned by\\nCaptain _Edwards_ very bravely, and the Engagement held for an Hour; but\\nCaptain _Edwards_, finding the Pyrate too strong for him, and fearing the\\nConsequence of too obstinate a Resistance against those lawless Fellows,\\nordered his Ensign to be struck. The Pyrates Boat came aboard, and not only\\nrifled the Ship, but whipp'd, beat, and cut the Men in a cruel Manner,\\nturned them aboard their own Ship, and then set Fire to their's.\\n\\nIn cruising about the Bay, they met and took several other Vessels without\\nany Resistance, _viz._ two Brigantines of _Boston_ in _New-England_, one of\\nwhich they burnt, and sunk the other; a Sloop belonging to _Connecticut_,\\nCaptain _Airs_, which they also burnt; a Sloop of _Jamaica_, Captain\\n_Hamilton_, they took for their own Use; a Sloop of _Virginia_ they\\nunladed, and was so generous as to give her back to the Master that own'd\\nher. They took a Sloop of 100 Ton, belonging to _Rhode Island_, which they\\nwere pleased to keep, and mount with eight Carriage, and ten Swivel Guns.\\n\\nWith this little Fleet, _viz._ Admiral _Lowther_, in the _Happy Delivery_;\\nCaptain _Low_, in the _Rhode Island_ Sloop; Captain _Harris_, (who was\\nsecond Mate in the _Greyhound_ when taken,) in _Hamilton_'s Sloop, and the\\nlittle Sloop formerly mentioned, serving as a Tender; I say, with this\\nFleet the Pyrates left the Bay, and came to _Port Mayo_ in the Gulph of\\n_Matique_, and there made Preparations to careen; they carried ashore all\\ntheir Sails, and made Tents by the Water-Side, wherein they laid their\\nPlunder, Stores, _&c._ and fell to work; and at the Time that the Ships\\nwere upon the Heel, and the good Folks employ'd in heaving down, scrubing,\\ntallowing, and so forth; of a sudden came down a considerable Body of the\\nNatives, and attack'd the Pyrates unprepared. As they were in no Condition\\nto defend themselves, they fled to their Sloops, leaving them Masters of\\nthe Field and the Spoil thereof, which was of great Value, and set Fire to\\nthe _Happy Delivery_, their capital Ship.\\n\\n_Lowther_ made the best Provision he could in the largest Sloop, which he\\ncalled the _Ranger_, having ten Guns and eight Swivels, and she sailing\\nbest, the Company went all aboard of her, and left the other at Sea.\\nProvisions was now very short, which, with the late Loss, put them in a\\nconfounded ill Humour, insomuch that they were every now and then going\\ntogether by the Ears, laying the Blame of their ill Conduct sometimes upon\\none, then upon another.\\n\\nThe Beginning of _May_ 1722, they got to the _West-Indies_, and near the\\nIsland of _Diseada_, took a Brigantine, one _Payne_ Master, that afforded\\nthem what they stood in need of, which put them in better Temper, and\\nBusiness seemed to go on well again. After they had pretty well plundered\\nthe Brigantine, they sent her to the Bottom. They went into the Island and\\nwatered, and then stood to the Northward, intending to visit the Main-Coast\\nof _America._\\n\\nIn the Latitude of 38, they took a Brigantine called the _Rebecca_ of\\n_Boston_, Captain _Smith_, bound thither from St. _Christophers._ At the\\ntaking of this Vessel, the Crews divided; for _Low_, whom _Lowther_ joined\\nat the _Grand Caimanes_, proving always a very unruly Member of the\\nCommonwealth, always aspiring, and never satisfy'd with the Proceedings of\\nthe Commander; he thought it the safest Way to get rid of him, upon any\\nTerms; and according to the Vote of the Company, they parted the Bear Skin\\nbetween them: _Low_ with 44 Hands went aboard the Brigantine, and _Lowther_\\nwith the same Number stay'd in the Sloop, and separated that very Night,\\nbeing the 28th of _May_ 1722.\\n\\n_Lowther_ proceeding on his Way to the Main-Coast, took three or four\\nfishing Vessels off _New-York_, which was no great Booty to the Captors.\\nThe 3d of _June_, they met with a small _New-England_ Ship, bound home from\\n_Barbadoes_, which stood an Attack a small Time, but finding it to no\\nPurpose, yielded herself a Prey to the Booters: The Pyrates took out of her\\nfourteen Hogsheads of Rum, six Barrels of Sugar, a large Box of _English_\\nGoods, several Casks of Loaf Sugar, a considerable Quantity of Pepper, six\\nNegroes, besides a Sum of Money and Plate, and then let her go on her\\nVoyage.\\n\\nThe next Adventure was not so fortunate for them, for coming pretty near\\nthe Coast of _South-Carolina_, they met with a Ship just come out, on her\\nVoyage to _England; Lowther_ gave her a Gun, and hoisted his pyratical\\nColours; but this Ship, which was called the _Amy_, happening to have a\\nbrave gallant Man to command her, who was not any ways daunted with that\\nterrible Ensign, the black Flag, he instead of striking immediately, as\\n'twas expected, let fly a Broadside at the Pyrate. _Lowther_ (not at all\\npleased with the Compliment, tho' he put up with it for the present) was\\nfor taking Leave; but the _Amy_ getting the Pyrate between her and the\\nShore, stood after him to clap him aboard; to prevent which, _Lowther_ run\\nthe Sloop a-ground, and landed all the Men with their Arms. Captain\\n_Gwatkins_, the Captain of the _Amy_, was obliged to stand off, for fear of\\nrunning his own Ship ashore; but at the same Time thought fit for the\\npublick Good, to destroy the Enemy; and thereupon went into the Boat, and\\nrowed towards the Sloop, in order to set her on Fire; but before he reached\\nthe Vessel, a fatal Shot from _Lowther_'s Company ashore, put an End to\\ntheir Design and Captain _Gwatkin_'s Life. After this unfortunate Blow, the\\nMate returned aboard with the Boat, and not being enclined to pursue them\\nany farther, took Charge of the Ship.\\n\\n_Lowther_ got off the Sloop after the Departure of the _Amy_, and brought\\nall his Men aboard again, but was in a poor shattered Condition, having\\nsuffered much in the Engagement, and had a great many Men kill'd and\\nwounded: He made Shift to get into an Inlet somewhere in _North-Carolina_,\\nwhere he staid a long while before he was able to put to Sea again.\\n\\nHe and his Crew laid up all the Winter, and shifted as well as they could\\namong the Woods, divided themselves into small Parties, and hunted\\ngenerally in the Day Times, killing of black Cattle, Hogs, _&c._ for their\\nSubsistance, and in the Night retired to their Tents and Huts, which they\\nmade for Lodging; and sometimes when the Weather grew very cold, they would\\nstay aboard of their Sloop.\\n\\nIn the Spring of the Year 1723, they made Shift to get to Sea, and steered\\ntheir Course for _Newfoundland_, and upon the Banks took a Scooner, call'd\\nthe _Swift, John Hood_ Master; they found a good Quantity of Provisions\\naboard her, which they very much wanted at that Time, and after taking\\nthree of their Hands, and plundering her of what they thought fit, they let\\nher depart. They took several other Vessels upon the Banks, and in the\\nHarbour, but none of any great Account; and then steering for a warmer\\nClimate, in _August_ arrived at the _West-Indies._ In their Passage\\nthither, they met with a Brigantine, called the _John_ and _Elizabeth,\\nRichard Stanny_ Master, bound for _Boston_, which they plundered, took two\\nof her Men, and discharged her.\\n\\n_Lowther_ cruised a pretty while among the Islands without any\\nextraordinary Success, and was reduced to a very small Allowance of\\nProvisions, till they had the luck to fall in with a _Martinico_ Man, which\\nproved a seasonable Relief to them; and after that, a _Guiney_ Man had the\\nill Fortune to become a Prey to the _Rovers_; she was called the\\n_Princess_, Captain _Wicksted_ Commander.\\n\\nIt was now thought necessary to look out for a Place to clean their Sloop\\nin, and prepare for new Adventures: Accordingly the Island of _Blanco_ was\\npitched upon for that Purpose, which lies in the Latitude of 11° 50 m. N.\\nabout 30 Leagues from the Main of the _Spanish America_, between the\\nIslands of _Margarita_ and _Rocas_, and not far from _Tortuga._ It is a low\\neven Island, but healthy and dry, uninhabited, and about two Leagues in\\nCircumference, with Plenty of Lignum Vitæ Trees thereon, growing in Spots,\\nwith shrubby Bushes of other Wood about them. There are, besides Turtle,\\ngreat Numbers of Guanoes, which is an amphibious Creature like a Lizard,\\nbut much larger, the Body of it being as big as a Man's Leg; they are very\\ngood to eat, and are much used by the Pyrates that come here: They are of\\ndivers Colours, but such as live upon dry Ground, as here at _Blanco_, are\\ncommonly yellow. On the N. W. End of this Island, there is a small Cove or\\nsandy Bay, all round the rest of the Island is deep Water, and steep close\\nto the Island. Here _Lowther_ resorted to, the Beginning of _October_ last,\\nunrigged his Sloop, sent his Guns, Sails, Rigging, _&c._ ashore, and put\\nhis Vessel upon the Careen. The _Eagle_ Sloop of _Barbadoes_, belonging to\\nthe _South-Sea_ Company, with 35 Hands, commanded by _Walter Moore_, coming\\nnear this Island, in her Voyage to _Comena_, on the _Spanish_ Continent,\\nsaw the said Sloop just careen'd, with her Guns out, and Sails unbent,\\nwhich she supposed to be a Pyrate, because it was a Place where Traders did\\nnot commonly use, so took the Advantage of attacking her, as she was then\\nunprepared; the _Eagle_ having fired a Gun to oblige her to shew her\\nColours, the Pyrate hoisted the St. _George_'s Flag at their Topmast-Head,\\nas it were to bid Defiance to her; but when they found _Moore_ and his Crew\\nresolved to board them in good earnest, the Pyrates cut their Cable and\\nhawled their Stern on Shore, which obliged the _Eagle_ to come to an Anchor\\na-thwart their Hawse, where she engaged them till they called for Quarter\\nand struck; at which Time _Lowther_ and twelve of the Crew made their\\nEscape out of the Cabin Window. The Master of the _Eagle_ got the Pyrate\\nSloop off, secured her, and went ashore with 25 Hands, in Pursuit of\\n_Lowther_ and his Gang; but after five Day's search, they could find but\\nfive of them, which they brought aboard, and then proceeded with the Sloop\\nand Pyrates to _Comena_ aforesaid, where they soon arrived.\\n\\nThe _Spanish_ Governor being informed of this brave Action, condemned the\\nSloop to the Captors, and sent a small Sloop with 23 Hands to scower the\\nBushes and other Places of the Island of _Blanco_, for the Pyrates that\\nremained there, and took four more, with seven small Arms, leaving behind\\nthem Captain _Lowther_, three Men, and a little Boy, which they could not\\ntake; the above four the _Spaniards_ try'd and condemned to Slavery for\\nLife; three to the Gallies, and the other to the Castle of _Arraria._\\n\\nThe _Eagle_ Sloop brought all their Prisoners afterwards to St.\\n_Christopher_'s, where the following were try'd by a Court of Vice\\nAdmiralty, there held _March_ the 11th, 1722, _viz. John Churchill, Edward\\nMackdonald, Nicholas Lewis, Richard West, Sam. Levercott, Robert White,\\nJohn Shaw, Andrew Hunter, Jonathan Delve, Matthew Freebarn, Henry Watson,\\nRoger Grange, Ralph Candor_, and _Robert Willis_; the three last were\\nacquitted, the other thirteen were found Guilty, two of which were\\nrecommended to Mercy by the Court, and accordingly pardoned; and the rest\\nexecuted at that Island, on the 20th of the same Month.\\n\\nAs for Captain _Lowther_, it is said that he afterwards shot himself upon\\nthat fatal Island, where his Pyracies ended, being found, by some Sloop's\\nMen, dead, and a Pistol burst by his Side.\\n\\nCHAP. XIII. OF Captain _Edward Low_, And his CREW.\\n\\nE_dward Low_ was born in _Westminster_, and had his Education there,\\nsuch as it was, for he could neither write or read. Nature seem'd to have\\ndesigned him for a Pyrate from his Childhood, for very early he began the\\nTrade of plundering, and was wont to raise Contributions among all the Boys\\nof _Westminster_; and if any were bold enough to refuse it, a Battle was\\nthe Consequence; but _Low_ was so hardy, as well as bold, there was no\\ngetting the better of him, so that he robbed the Youths of their Farthings,\\nwith Impunity; when he grew bigger he took to Gaming in a low Way, for it\\nwas commonly among the Footmen in the _Lobby_ of the House of Commons,\\nwhere he used to play the whole Game, (as they term it,) that is, cheat all\\nhe could, and those who pretended to dispute it with him, must fight him.\\n\\nThe Virtues of some of his Family were equal to his; one of his Brothers\\nwas a Youth of Genius, when he was but seven Years old, he used to be\\ncarried in a Basket, upon a Porter's Back, into a Crowd, and snatch Hats\\nand Wigs: According to the exact Chronology of _Newgate_, he was the first\\nwho practised this ingenious Trick. After this, he applied himself to\\npicking of Pockets; when he increased in Strength, he attempted greater\\nThings, such as House-breaking, _&c._ But after he had run a short Race, he\\nhad the Misfortune of ending his Days at _Tyburn_, in Company with _Stephen\\nBunce_, and the celebrated _Jack Hall_ the Chimney-Sweeper.\\n\\nBut to return to _Ned_, when he came to Man's Estate, at his eldest\\nBrother's Desire, he went to Sea with him, and so continued for three or\\nfour Years, and then parted; and _Ned_ work'd in a Rigging-House in\\n_Boston_ in _New-England_, for a while. About six Years ago, he took a Trip\\nhome to _England_, to see his Mother, who is yet Living. His Stay was not\\nlong here; but taking Leave of his Friends and Acquaintance, for the last\\nTime he should see them; for so he was pleased to say; he returned to\\n_Boston_, and work'd a Year or two longer at the Rigging Business. But\\nbeing too apt to disagree with his Masters, he left them, and shipp'd\\nhimself in a Sloop that was bound to the Bay of _Honduras._\\n\\nWhen the Sloop arrived in the Bay, _Ned Low_ was appointed Patron of the\\nBoat, which was employ'd in cutting of Logwood, and bringing it aboard to\\nlade the Ship; for that is the Commodity they make the Voyage for: In the\\nBoat were twelve Men besides _Low_, who all go arm'd, because of the\\n_Spaniards_, from whom this Logwood is but little better than stole. It\\nhappened that the Boat one Day came aboard just before Dinner was ready,\\nand _Low_ desired that they might stay and Dine; but the Captain, being in\\na Hurry for his Lading, ordered them a Bottle of Rum, and to take t'other\\nTrip, because no Time should be lost: This provoked the Boat's Crew, but\\nparticularly _Low_, who takes up a loaded Musquet and fires at the Captain,\\nbut missing him, shot another poor Fellow thro' the Head, then put off the\\nBoat, and with his twelve Companions goes to Sea: The next Day they took a\\nsmall Vessel, and go in her, make a black Flag, and declare War against all\\nthe World.\\n\\nThey then proceeded to the Island of the _Grand Caimanes_, intending to\\nhave fitted up their small Vessel, and prepare themselves as well as their\\nCircumstances would permit, for their honourable Employment; but falling in\\nCompany with _George Lowther_, another Pyrate there, who paying his\\nCompliments to _Low_, as great Folks do to one another when they meet, and\\noffering himself as an Ally; _Low_ accepted of the Terms, and so the Treaty\\nwas presently sign'd without Plenipo's or any other Formalities.\\n\\nWe have already given an Account of their joynt Pyracies, under _Lowther_\\nas chief Commander, till the 28th of _May_, 1722, when they took a\\nBrigantine of _Boston_, bound thither from St. _Christophers_, at which\\nTime they parted, and _Edward Low_ went into the Brigantine, with forty\\nfour others, who chose him their Captain: They took with them two Guns,\\nfour Swivels, six Quarter-Casks of Powder, Provisions and some Stores, and\\nso left _Lowther_ to prosecute his Adventures, with the Men he had left.\\n\\nTheir first Adventure in the Brigantine, was on _Sunday_ the 3d Day of\\n_June_, when they took a Vessel belonging to _Amboy, John Hance_ Master,\\nwhom he rifled of his Provisions, and let go; the same Day he met with a\\nSloop, _James Calquhoon_ Master, off of _Rhode Island_, bound into that\\nPort, whom he first plundered, and then cut away his Boltsprit, and all his\\nRigging, also his Sails from the Yards, and wounded the Master, to prevent\\nhis getting in to give Intelligence, and then stood away to the\\nSouth-Eastward, with all the Sail he could make, there being then but\\nlittle Wind.\\n\\n_Low_ judged right in making sail from the Coast, for a longer stay had\\nproved fatal to him, for notwithstanding the disabled Condition he had\\nrendered the Sloop in, she made shift to get into _Block Island_, at 12\\no'Clock that Night, and immediately dispatched a Whale-Boat to _Rhode\\nIsland_, which got thither by seven the next Morning, with an Account of\\nthe Pyrate, his Force, and what had happened to him: As soon as the\\nGovernor had received this Information, he ordered a Drum to beat up for\\nVolunteers, and two of the best Sloops then in the Harbour, to be fitted\\nout: He gave Commissions to one Captain _John Headland_, and Captain _John\\nBrown_, jun. for ten Days; the former had eight Guns and two Swivels, and\\nthe latter six Guns, well fitted with small Arms, and in both Sloops 140\\nstout Fellows; all this was performed with so much Expedition, that before\\nSun-set, they were under Sail, turning out of the Harbour, at the same Time\\nthe Pyrate was seen from _Block Island_, which gave great Hopes that the\\nSloops would be Masters of her the next Day, which however did not happen,\\nfor the Sloops returned into Harbour some Days afterwards, without so much\\nas seeing their Enemy.\\n\\nAfter this Escape, Captain _Low_, went into Port, upon the Coast, for he\\nhad not fresh Water enough to run to the Islands, where he staid a few\\nDays, getting Provisions and what Necessaries the Crew wanted, and then\\nsailed for Purchase, (as they call it) steering their Course towards\\n_Marblehead._\\n\\nAbout the 12th of _July_, the Brigantine sailed into the Harbour of Port\\n_Rosemary_, and there found thirteen Ships and Vessels, but none of Force,\\nat Anchor, they spread their black Flag, and ran in among them; _Low_\\ntelling them from the Brigantine, they should have no Quarters if they\\nresisted; in the mean Time they mann'd and arm'd their Boat, and took\\nPossession of every one of them, plundered them of what they thought fit,\\nand converted one to their own Use, _viz._ a Scooner of 80 Tuns, aboard of\\nwhich they put 10 Carriage Guns, and 50 Men, and _Low_ himself went\\nCaptain, and nam'd her the _Fancy_, making one _Charles Harris_, (who was\\nat first forced into their Service out of the _Greyhound_ of _Boston_, by\\n_Lowther_, of which Ship _Harris_ was second Mate) Captain of the\\nBrigantine: Out of these Vessels they took several Hands, and encreased the\\nCompany to 80 Men, who all signed the Articles, some willingly, and a few\\nperhaps by Force, and so sailed away from _Marblehead._\\n\\nSome Time after this, they met with two Sloops bound for _Boston_, with\\nProvisions for the Garrison, and the Scooner coming up first, attacked\\nthem, but there happening to be an Officer and some Soldiers on Board, who\\ngave them a warm Reception, _Low_ chose to stay till he should be joyned by\\nthe Brigantine; in the mean while the Sloops made the best of their Way,\\nand the Pyrates gave them Chace two Days, and at last lost sight of them in\\na Fog.\\n\\nThey now steered for the Leeward Islands, but in their Voyage met with such\\na Hurricane of Wind, that the like had not been known; the Sea ran\\nMountains high, and seemed to threaten them every Moment with Destruction;\\nit was no Time now to look out for Plunder, but to save themselves, if\\npossible, from perishing. All Hands were continually employed Night, and\\nDay, on Board the Brigantine, and all little enough, for the Waves went\\nover her, so that they were forced to keep the pump constantly going,\\nbesides baling with Buckets; but finding themselves not able to keep her\\nfree, and seeing the utmost Danger before their Eyes, they turn'd to the\\nTakle, and hoisted out their Provisions, and other heavy Goods, and threw\\nthem over-board, with six of their Guns, so that by lightening the Vessel,\\nshe might rise to the Top of the Sea with the Waves: They were also going\\nto cut away their Mast; but considering how dangerous it would be, to be\\nleft in such a Condition, they resolved to delay it to the last, which was\\nPrudence in them to do; for a Ship without Masts or Sails, lies like a Log\\nupon the Water, and if attack'd, must fight with Disadvantage, the working\\nof her being the most artful Part of the Engagement, because she may\\nsometimes bring all her great Guns on one Side, to bear upon her Enemy,\\nwhen the disabled Ship can do little or nothing.\\n\\nBut to proceed; by their throwing over-board the heavy Goods, the Vessel\\nmade considerable less Water, and they could keep it under with the Pump\\nonly, which gave them Hopes and new Life; so that instead of cutting all\\naway, they took necessary Measures to secure the Mast, by making\\nPreventor-Shrowds, _&c._ and then wore and lay too upon the other Tack,\\ntill the Storm was over. The Scooner made somewhat better Weather of it, of\\nthe two, but was pretty roughly handled notwithstanding, having split her\\nMain-sail, sprung her Boltsprit, and cut her Anchors from her Bows. The\\nBrigantine by running away to Leeward, when she wore upon the Larboard\\nTack, had lost Sight of the Scooner; but not knowing whether she might be\\nsafe or not, as soon as the Wind abated, she set her Main-Sail and\\nTop-Sail, and made short Trips to Windward; and the next Day had the good\\nFortune to come in Sight of their Consort, who, upon a Signal, which the\\nother knew, bore down to her, and the Crew were overjoy'd to meet again,\\nafter such ill Treatment from the Winds and Seas.\\n\\nAfter the Storm, _Low_ got safe to a small Island, one of the Weathermost\\nof the _Caribbees_, and there fitted their Vessels, as well as the Place\\ncould afford; they got Provisions of the Natives, in exchange for Goods of\\ntheir own; and as soon as the Brigantine was ready, 'twas judg'd necessary\\nto take a short Cruize, and leave the Scooner in the Harbour till her\\nReturn. The Brigantine sail'd out accordingly, and had not been out many\\nDays before they met a Ship at Sea, that had lost all her Masts; on Board\\nof whom they went, and took from her in Money and Goods, to the Value of\\n1000 _l._ and so left her in the Condition they found her: This Ship was\\nbound home from _Barbadoes_, but losing her Masts in the late Storm, was\\nmaking for _Antegoa_, to refit, where she afterwards arriv'd.\\n\\nThe Storm just spoken of, was found to have done incredible Damage in those\\nParts of the World; but however, it appear'd to have been more violent at\\n_Jamaica_, both to the Island and Shipping, there was such a prodigious\\nSwell of the Sea, that several hundred Tuns of Stones and Rocks, were\\nthrown over the Wall of the Town of _Port Royal_, and the Town it self was\\noverflowed, and above half destroy'd, there being the next Morning five\\nFoot Water from one End to the other; the Cannon of Fort _Charles_ were\\ndismounted, and some washed into the Sea, and four hundred People lost\\ntheir Lives; a more melancholly Sight was scarce ever seen when the Water\\nebb'd away, all the Streets being covered with Ruins of Houses, Wrecks of\\nVessels, and a great Number of dead Bodies, for forty Sail of Ships, in the\\nHarbour, were cast away.\\n\\nThe Brigantine return'd to the Island, where she had left the Scooner, who\\nbeing ready to sail, it was put to the Vote of the Company, what Voyage to\\ntake next; and herein they follow'd the Advice of the Captain, who thought\\nit not adviseable to go any farther to Leeward, because of the Men of War\\nwho were cruising in their several Stations, which they were not at all\\nfond of meeting, and therefore it was agreed to go to the _Azores_, or\\nWestern Islands.\\n\\nThe latter End of _July, Low_ took a _French_ Ship of 34 Guns, and carried\\nher along with him to the _Azores._ He came into St. _Michael_'s Road the\\n3d of _August_, and took seven Sail that were lying there, _viz._ the\\n_Nostre Dame, Mere de Dieu_, Captain _Roach_ Commander; the _Dove_, Capt.\\n_Cox_; the _Rose_ Pink, formerly a Man of War, Capt. _Thompson_; another\\n_English_ Ship, Capt. _Chandler_; and three other Vessels. He threatened\\nall with present Death who resisted, which struck such a Terror to them,\\nthat they yielded themselves up a Prey to the Villains, without firing a\\nGun.\\n\\nThe Pyrates being in great Want of Water and fresh Provisions, _Low_ sent\\nto the Governor of St. _Michael_'s for a Supply, and promised upon that\\nCondition to release the Ships he had taken, but otherwise to burn them\\nall; which Demand the Governor thought it not prudent to refuse, but sent\\nthe Provision he required, upon which he released six of the Ships, (after\\nhe had plundered them of what he thought fit,) and the other, _viz._ the\\n_Rose_ Pink, was made a Pyrate Ship, which _Low_ himself took the Command\\nof.\\n\\nThe Pyrates took several of the Guns out of the _French_ Ship, and mounted\\nthem aboard the _Rose_, which proved very fit for their Turn, and condemned\\nthe former to the Flames. They took all the Crew out of her, but the Cook,\\nwho, they said, being a greazy Fellow would fry well in the Fire; so the\\npoor Man was bound to the Main-Mast, and burnt in the Ship, to the no small\\nDiversion of _Low_ and his _Mirmidons._\\n\\n_Low_ ordered the Scooner to lye in the Fare between St. _Michael_'s and\\nSt. _Mary_'s, where, about the 20th of _August_, Captain _Carter_ in the\\n_Wright_ Galley, had the ill Fortune to come in her Way; and because at\\nfirst they shewed Inclinations to defend themselves, and what they had, the\\nPyrates cut and mangled them in a barbarous Manner; particularly some\\n_Portuguese_ Passengers, two of which being Friers, they triced up at each\\nArm of the Fore-Yard, but let them down again before they were quite dead,\\nand this they repeated several Times out of Sport.\\n\\nAnother _Portuguese_, who was also Captain _Carter_'s Passenger, putting on\\na sorrowful Countenance at what he saw acted, one of this vile Crew\\nattacked him upon the Deck, saying, _he did not like his Looks_, and\\nthereupon gave him one Blow a-cross his Belly with his Cutlash, that cut\\nout his Bowels, and he fell down dead without speaking a Word. At the same\\nTime another of these Rogues cutting at a Prisoner, missed his Mark, and\\nCaptain _Low_ standing in his Way, very opportunely received the Stroke\\nupon his under Jaw, which laid the Teeth bare; upon this the Surgeon was\\ncalled, who immediately stitched up the Wound, but _Low_ finding fault with\\nthe Operation, the Surgeon being tollerably drunk, as it was customary for\\nevery Body to be, struck _Low_ such a Blow with his Fist, that broke out\\nall the Stitches, and then bid him sew up his Chops himself and be damned,\\nso that _Low_ made a very pitiful Figure for some Time after.\\n\\nWhen they had plundered Captain _Carter_'s Ship, several of them were for\\nburning her, as they had done the _French_ Man, but it was otherwise\\nresolved at last; for after they had cut her Cables, Rigging and Sails to\\nPieces, they left her to the Mercy of the Sea.\\n\\nAfter these Depredations, they steered for the Island of _Madera_, where\\nmissing other Booty, they took up with a Fishing-Boat, with two old Men and\\na Boy in her, one of which they detained on Board, but sent the other\\nashore with a Flag of Truce, demanding a Boat of Water of the Governor, on\\nPain of taking away the old Man's Life, whom they threatened to hang at the\\nYard-Arm, upon their refusal; but the Thing being complied with, the old\\nMan was honourably (as the Pyrates say) discharged, and all the three much\\nhandsomer cloathed than when they took them. From this Island they sailed\\nto the _Canaries_, but meeting with no Prey there, they continued their\\nCourse for the _Cape de Verd_ Islands, and at _Bonavista_, took a Ship\\ncalled the _Liverpool Merchant_, Captain _Goulding_, from whom they stole a\\ngreat Quantity of Provisions and dry Goods, 300 Gallons of Brandy, two Guns\\nand Carriages, a Mast, Yard and Hawsers, besides six of his Men, and then\\nwould not let them Trade there, nor at St. _Nicholas_, but obliged Captain\\n_Goulding_ to go with his Ship, to the Isle of _May._\\n\\nThe Pyrate also took among these Islands, a Ship belonging to _Liverpool,\\nScot_ Commander; two _Portuguese_ Sloops bound for _Brasil_; a small\\n_English_ Sloop trading there, _James Pease_ Master, bound to _Sancta\\nCrux_, and three Sloops from St. _Thomas_ bound to _Curaso_, the Masters\\nNames were _Lilly, Staples_ and _Simpkins_, all which they plundered, and\\nthen let go about their Business, except one Sloop which they fitted up for\\nthe following Purpose.\\n\\n_Low_ had heard by one of the above mentioned Ships, that two small Gallies\\nwere expected every Day at the _Western Islands, viz._ the _Greyhound_,\\nCaptain _Glass_, and the _Joliff_, Captain _Aram_; the former of which was\\ndesigned to be fitted for the pyratical Trade to _Brasil_, if Things had\\nhappened to their Minds. They mann'd the Sloop, and sent her in Quest of\\none or both of these Ships to the _Western Islands_ aforesaid, whilst they\\ncarreen'd their Ship _Rose_, at one of the _Cape de Verds_: But now Fortune\\nthat had hitherto been so propitious to them, left her Minions, and baffled\\nfor the present all their Hopes, for the Sloop missing of their Prey, was\\nreduced to great Necessities for want of Provisions and Water, so that they\\nventured to go ashore at St. _Michael_'s for a Supply, and pass for a\\nTrader; but they play'd their Parts so aukwardly, that they were suspected\\nby the Governor to be what they really were, and he was soon put out of\\ndoubt by a Visit some _Portuguese_ made them, who happened unluckily to be\\nPassengers in Captain _Carter_'s Ship, when _Low_ took her, and knew the\\nGentlemen's Faces very well; upon which the whole Crew was conducted into\\nthe Castle, where they were provided for as long as they liv'd.\\n\\n_Low_, in the mean Time, did not fare quite so ill, but had his intended\\nVoyage to _Brasil_ spoil'd, by the oversetting of his Ship, when she was\\nupon the Careen, whereby she was lost, so that he was reduc'd to his old\\nScooner, which he called the _Fancy_, aboard of which they all went, to the\\nNumber of 100, as vile Rogues as ever ended their Lives at _Tyburn._ They\\nproceeded now to the _West-Indies_, but before they had gotten far on their\\nVoyage, they attack'd a rich _Portuguese_ Ship, call'd the _Nostre Signiora\\nde Victoria_, bound home from _Bahia_, and after some Resistance, took her.\\n_Low_ tortur'd several of the Men, to make them declare where the Money,\\n(which he suppos'd they had on Board) lay, and extorted by that Means, a\\nConfession that the Captain had, during the Chace, hung out of the Cabin\\nWindow, a Bag with 11,000 Moidores, which, assoon as he was taken, he cut\\nthe Rope off, and let it drop into the Sea.\\n\\n_Low_, upon hearing what a Prize had escap'd him, rav'd like a Fury, swore\\na thousand Oaths, and ordered the Captain's Lips to be cut off, which he\\nbroil'd before his Face, and afterwards murthered him and all the Crew,\\nbeing thirty two Persons.\\n\\nAfter this bloody Action, they continued their Course, till they came to\\nthe Northward of all the Islands, and there cruiz'd for about a Month, in\\nwhich Time they made Prizes of the following Vessels, _viz._ a Snow from\\n_New-York_ to _Curacoa, Robert Leonard_ Master; a Sloop from the Bay, bound\\nto _New-York, Craig_ Master; a Snow from _London_ and _Jamaica_, bound to\\n_New-York_; and the _Stanhope_ Pink, _Andrew Delbridge_ Master, from\\n_Jamaica_ to _Boston_; which last they burnt, because of _Low_'s\\nirreconcileable Aversion to _New-England_ Men.\\n\\nAfter this Cruize, they went into one of the Islands and clean'd, and then\\nsteered for the Bay of _Honduras_, where they arrived about the Middle of\\n_March_ 1722-3, and met a Sloop turning out of the said Bay. The Pyrates\\nhad hoisted up _Spanish_ Colours, and continued them till they drew near\\nthe Sloop, then they hall'd them down, hoisted their black Flag, fired a\\nBroadside, and boarded her. This Sloop was a _Spaniard_ of six Guns, and 70\\nMen, that came into the Bay that Morning, and meeting there with five\\n_English_ Sloops, and a Pink, made Prizes of them all, plundered them, and\\nbrought the Masters of the Vessels away Prisoners, for the ransom of the\\nLogwood; their Names were _Tuthill, Norton, Newbury, Sprafort, Clark_ and\\n_Parrot._ The _Spaniards_ made no Resistance, so that the _English_ Pyrates\\nsoon became their Masters and fell to rifling; but finding the\\nabove-mentioned People in the Hold, and several _English_ Goods, they\\nconsulted _Low_ the Captain thereupon, and without examining any further,\\nthe Resolution pass'd to kill all the Company; and the Pyrates, without any\\nCeremony, fell Pell-Mell to Execution with their Swords, Cutlashes,\\nPoll-Axes and Pistols, cutting, slashing and shooting the poor _Spaniards_\\nat a sad Rate. Some of the miserable Creatures jump'd down into the Hold,\\nbut could not avoid the Massacre; they met Death every where, for if they\\nescaped it from one Hand, they were sure to perish by another; the only\\nProspect they had of Life, was to fly from the Rage of those merciless Men,\\nand to trust to the more merciful Sea; and accordingly a great many leap'd\\nover-board, and swam for the Shore; but _Low_ perceiving it, ordered the\\nCanoa to be mann'd, and sent in pursuit of them, by which Means several of\\nthe poor unhappy Men were knock'd in the Head in the Water, as they were\\nendeavouring to get to Land; however, about 12 of them did reach the Shore,\\nbut in a miserable Condition, being very much wounded, and what became of\\nthem afterwards was not known, except one, who while the Pyrates were at\\ntheir Sports and Pastimes ashore, finding himself very weak and fainting\\nwith his Wounds, and not knowing where to go for Help and Relief, in this\\nExtremity, he came back to them, and begg'd for God sake, in the most\\nearnest Manner possible, that they would give him Quarters; upon which, one\\nof the Villains took hold of him, and said, _G-- d--n him, he would give\\nhim good Quarters presently_, and made the poor _Spaniard_ kneel down on\\nhis Knees, then taking his Fusil, put the Muzzle of it into his Mouth, and\\nfired down his Throat. 'Twas thought the rest did not long survive their\\nmiserable Condition, and could only prolong their Lives, to add to the\\nMisery of them.\\n\\nWhen the murdering Work was over, they rumaged the _Spanish_ Pyrate, and\\nbrought all the Booty aboard their own Vessels: The six Masters\\naforementioned, found in the Hold, they restored to their respective\\nVessels: They forced away the Carpenter from the Pink, and then set Fire to\\nthe _Spanish_ Sloop, and burnt her; which last Scene concluded the\\nDestruction of their Enemy, Ship and Crew.\\n\\n_Low_ set the Masters of the Vessels free, but would not suffer them to\\nsteer for _Jamaica_, where they were then bound, for fear the Men of War\\nshould get Intelligence of them, but forced them all to go to _New-York_,\\nthreat'ning them with Death, when they met them again, if they refused to\\ncomply with their Demands.\\n\\nIn the next Cruize, which was between the Leeward Islands and the Main,\\nthey took two Snows, bound from _Jamaica_ to _Liverpool_, and a Snow from\\n_Jamaica_ to _London, Bridds_ Master; as also a Ship from _Biddford_ to\\n_Jamaica, John Pinkham_ Commander; and two Sloops from _Jamaica_ to\\n_Virginia._\\n\\nOn the 27th of _May, Low_ and his Consort _Harris_, came off\\n_South-Carolina_, and met with three good Ships, _viz._ the _Crown_,\\nCaptain _Lovereigne_, the _King William_, the _Carteret_, and a Brigantine,\\nwho all came out of _Carolina_ together two Days before. The Pyrates were\\nat the Trouble of chacing them, and Captain _Lovereigne_ being the\\nsternmost, she fell first a Prey into their Hands; and they spent all the\\nDay in coming up with the rest.\\n\\nWithin a few Days they took a Ship called the _Amsterdam Merchant_, Captain\\n_Willard_, from _Jamaica_, but belonging to _New-England_; as _Low_ let\\nnone of that Country depart without some Marks of his Rage, he cut off this\\nGentleman's Ears, slit up his Nose, and cut him in several Places of his\\nBody, and, after plundering his Ship, let him pursue his Voyage.\\n\\nAfter this he took a Sloop bound to _Amboy, William Frazier_, Master, with\\nwhom Mr. _Low_ happening to be displeased, he ordered lighted Matches to be\\nty'd between the Mens Fingers, which burnt all the Flesh off the Bones;\\nthen cut them in several Parts of their Bodies with Knives and Cutlashes;\\nafterwards took all their Provisions away, and set some of them ashore in\\nan uninhabited Part of the Country.\\n\\nThe _Kingston_, Captain _Estwick_, another Ship, one _Burrington_ Master,\\ntwo Brigantines from _Carolina_ to _London_; a Sloop from _Virginia_ to\\n_Bermudas_; a Ship from _Glasgow_ to _Virginia_; a Scooner from _New-York_\\nto _South-Carolina_; a Pink from _Virginia_ to _Dartmouth_, and a Sloop\\nfrom _Philadelphia_ to _Surinam_, fell a Prey to these Villains, upon this\\nCruize, besides those above-mentioned.\\n\\nIt happened that at this Time one of his Majesty's Ships was upon a Cruize,\\non this Station, and got Intelligence of some of the mischievous Actions of\\nthis Miscreant, by one of the Vessels that had been plundered by him, who\\nsteering as directed, came in Sight of the Pyrates by break of Day, on the\\n10th of _June_, of all Days in the Year. The Rovers looking out for Prey,\\nsoon saw, and gave Chace to the Man of War, which was called the\\n_Greyhound_, a Ship of 20 Guns, and 120 Men, rather inferiour in Force to\\nthe two Pyrate Vessels: The _Greyhound_ finding them so eager, was in no\\ndoubt what they should be, and therefore tack'd and stood from them, giving\\nthe Pyrates an Opportunity to chace her for two Hours, till all Things were\\nin Readiness for an Engagement, and the Pyrates about Gun-shot off; then\\nthe _Greyhound_ tack'd again, and stood towards the two Sloops, one of them\\ncalled the _Fancy_, commanded by _Low_ himself, and the other the _Ranger_,\\ncommanded by _Harris_, both which hoisted their pyratical Colours, and\\nfired each a Gun. When the _Greyhound_ came within Musquet-shot, she halled\\nup her Main-sail, and clapp'd close upon a Wind, to keep the Pyrates from\\nrunning to Leeward, and then engaged: But when the Rogues found who they\\nhad to deal with, they edg'd away under the Man of War's Stern, and the\\n_Greyhound_ standing after them, they made a running Fight for about two\\nHours; but little Wind happening, the Sloops gained from her, by the help\\nof their Oars; upon which the _Greyhound_ left off firing, and turned all\\nHands to her own Oars, and at three in the Afternoon came up with them. The\\nPyrates haul'd upon a Wind to receive the Man of War, and the Fight was\\nimmediately renewed, with a brisk Fire on both Sides, till the _Ranger_'s\\nMain-Yard was shot down, and the _Greyhound_ pressing close upon the\\ndisabled Sloop, _Low_, in the other, thought fit to bear away and leave his\\nConsort a Sacrifice to his Enemy, who (seing the Cowardice and Treachery of\\nhis Commadore and Leader, having ten or twelve Men killed and wounded, and\\nthat there was no possibility of escaping,) called out for Quarters, and\\nsurrendered themselves to Justice, which proved severe enough to them\\na-while afterwards.\\n\\nThe Conduct of _Low_ was surprizing in this Adventure, because his reputed\\nCourage and Boldness, had, hitherto, so possess'd the Minds of all People,\\nthat he became a Terror, even to his own Men; but his Behaviour throughout\\nthis whole Action, shewed him to be a base cowardly Villain, for had\\n_Low_'s Sloop fought half so briskly as _Harris_'s had done, (as they were\\nunder a solemn Oath to do,) the Man of War, in my Opinion, could never have\\nhurted them.\\n\\nThe _Greyhound_ carried in their Prize to _Rhode Island_, to the great Joy\\nof the whole Province, tho' it had been more compleat, if the great _LOW_\\nhimself had grac'd the Triumph. The Prisoners were strongly secured in a\\nGoal, till a Court of Vice-Admiralty could be held for their Tryals, which\\nbegun on the 10th of _July_, at _Newport_, and continued three Days. The\\nCourt was made up of the following Gentlemen.\\n\\n_William Dummer_, Esq; Lieutenant Governor of the _Massachusets_,\\nPresident. _Nathaniel Paine_, Esq; _Addington Davonport_, Esq; _Thomas\\nFitch_, Esq; _Spencer Phipps_, Esq; _John Lechmere_, Esq; Surveyor-General.\\n_John Valentine_, Esq; Advocate-General. _Samuel Cranston_, Governor of\\n_Rhode-Island._ _John Menzies_, Esq; Judge of the Admiralty, _Richard\\nWard_, Esq; Register.

WE therefore, the Mayor, Aldermen\\nand Commonalty of the City of_ New-York, _assembled in Common Council, to\\nexpress our grateful Sense and Acknowledgment, to the said Captain_ Peter\\nSolgard, _for so noble and faithful a Discharge of his Duty, and as a\\nparticular Mark of the great Esteem and just Regard we bear to his kind\\nAcceptance of the Freedom of the Corporation of this City of_ New-York,\\n_and that he will please to become a Fellow Citizen with us._ These are\\ntherefore _to certify and declare, that the said Captain_ Peter Solgard _is\\nhereby admitted, received and allowed a Freeman and Citizen of the said\\nCity of_ New-York, _to have, hold, enjoy and partake of all and singular\\nAdvantages, Benefits, Liberties, Privileges, Franchises, Freedoms and\\nImmunities whatsoever, granted or belonging to the same City_: In Testimony\\n_thereof, the said Mayor hath hereunto subscribed his Name, and caused the\\nSeal of the said City to be affix'd the_ 25_th Day of_ July, _in the ninth\\nYear of the Reign of our Sovereign Lord_ George, _by the Grace of God, King\\nof_ Great Britain, France _and_ Ireland, _Defender of the Faith_, &c. Anno.\\nDom. 1723.\\n\\nWilliam Sharpas, _Clerk._\\n\\nR. Walter _Mayor._\\n\\nThis narrow Escape of _Low_ and his Companions, one would have thought\\nmight have brought them to a little Consideration of their black and horrid\\nCrimes, and to look upon this Interval as an Opportunity put into their\\nHands by Providence, to reconcile themselves to God, by a hearty and\\nsincere Repentance. But alass they were dead to all Goodness, and had not\\nso much as one Spark of Virtue to stir them up to be thankful for such an\\neminent Deliverance: But instead thereof, vented a Million of Oaths and\\nCurses upon the Captain of the _Greyhound_, vowing to execute Vengeance\\nupon all they should meet with afterwards, for the Indignity he put upon\\nthem.\\n\\nThe first Prey that they met with, after their Flight, was a small Sloop\\nbelonging to _Nantucket_, a Whale-Fishing, about 80 Miles from Land; the\\nMaster of which, one _Nathan Skiff_, a brisk young Fellow, the Pyrates\\ncruelly whipp'd naked about the Deck, making his Torture their Sport; after\\nwhich they cut of his Ears, and last of all shot him through the Head, and\\nthen sunk his Vessel; putting the rest of the Hands into their Whale-Boat,\\nwith a Compass, a little Water, and a few Biskets; and it being good\\nWeather, they providentially got safe to _Nantucket_, beyond all\\nExpectation.\\n\\nThere was another Whale-Boat belonging to this Sloop last mentioned, which\\nhappened to be at some Distance from her, and perceiving what was doing,\\nrowed with all speed to another Sloop not far off, to acquaint her with the\\nMisfortune, that the Men might take Care of themselves; and she happily got\\naway in Time. Some Days after, _Low_ took a Fishing-Boat off of _Block\\nIsland_, but did not perpetrate so much Cruelty to her, contenting himself\\nwith only cutting off the Master's Head: But after taking two Whale-Boats\\nnear _Rhode Island_, he caused one of the Master's Bodies to be ripp'd up,\\nand his Intrails to be taken out; and cut off the Ears of the other, and\\nmade him eat them himself with Pepper and Salt; which hard Injunction he\\ncomply'd with, without making a Word. Several other Persons he would have\\nmurthered, but Humanity prevailing in the tender Hearts of his Companions,\\nthey refused to put his savage Orders in Execution. From the Coast of\\n_New-England, Low_ sailed directly for _Newfoundland_, and, near Cape\\n_Briton_, took two or three and twenty _French_ Vessels; and one of them of\\n22 Guns he mann'd with Pyrates, making a sort of a Man of War of her; with\\nwhich he scower'd the Harbours and Banks of _Newfoundland_, and took\\nsixteen or eighteen other Ships and Vessels, all which they plundered, and\\nsome destroyed.\\n\\nThus these inhumane Wretches went on, who could not be contented to satisfy\\ntheir Avarice only, and travel in the common Road of Wickedness; but, like\\ntheir Patron, the Devil, must make Mischief their Sport, Cruelty their\\nDelight, and damning of Souls their constant Employment. Of all the\\npyratical Crews that were ever heard of, none of the _English_ Name came up\\nto this, in Barbarity; their Mirth and their Anger had much the same\\nEffect, for both were usually gratified with the Cries and Groans of their\\nPrisoners; so that they almost as often murthered a Man from the Excess of\\ngood Humour, as out of Passion and Resentment; and the Unfortunate could\\nnever be assured of Safety from them, for Danger lurked in their very\\nSmiles. An Instance of this had liked to have happened to one Captain\\n_Graves_, Master of a _Virginia_ Ship last taken; for as soon as he came\\naboard of the Pyrate, _Low_ takes a Bowl of Punch in his Hand, and drinks\\nto him, saying, _Captain_ Graves, _here's half this to you._ But the poor\\nGentleman being too sensibly touched at the Misfortune of falling into his\\nHands, modestly desired to be excused, for that he could not drink;\\nwhereupon _Low_ draws out a Pistol, cocks it, and with the Bowl in 'tother\\nHand, told him, he should either take one or the other: So _Graves_,\\nwithout Hesitation, made Choice of the Vehicle that contained the Punch,\\nand guttled down about a Quart, when he had the least Inclination that ever\\nhe had in his Life to be merry.\\n\\nThe latter End of _July_, (1723,) _Low_ took a large Ship, called the\\n_Merry Christmas_, and fitted her for a Pyrate, cut several Ports in her,\\nand mounted her with 34 Guns. _Low_ goes aboard of this Ship, assumes the\\nTitle of Admiral, and hoists a black Flag, with the Figure of Death in red,\\nat the Main-topmast Head, and takes another Voyage to the _Western\\nIslands_, where he arrived the Beginning of _September._ The first Vessel\\nhe met with there, was a Brigantine, formerly an _English_ Sloop, commanded\\nby _Elias Wild_, but lately bought by a _Portuguese_ Nobleman, and altered:\\nShe was manned partly with _English_, and partly _Portuguese_; the latter\\n_Low_ caused to be hang'd, by Way of Reprisal, for some of his own Men sent\\nthither in a Sloop from the _Cape de Verd_ Islands, as has been mentioned:\\nThe _English_ Men he thrust into their own Boat, to shift for themselves,\\nand set Fire to the Vessel.\\n\\nAt St. _Michaels_, they sent in their Boats and cut out of the Road, a new\\n_London_ built Ship of 14 Guns, commanded by Captain _Thompson_, who was\\ntaken there the Year before, by _Low_, in the _Rose_ Pink. The Boats had\\nfewer Men than the Ship, and Captain _Thompson_ would have defended\\nhimself, but his Men through Cowardize, or too great an Inclination of\\nbecoming Pyrates themselves, refused to stand by him, and he was obliged to\\nsurrender; and when he came aboard the Pyrate, had his Ears cut off close\\nto his Head, for only proposing to resist Admiral _Low_'s black Flag; they\\ngave him one of his own Boats, and burnt his Ship.\\n\\nThe next was a _Portuguese_ Bark that fell into their Hands, whose Men came\\noff somewhat better than usual, for they only cut them with their\\nCutlashes, out of Wantonness, turned them all into their Boat, and set\\ntheir Vessel on Fire. When the Boat was going from the Side of the Ship,\\none of _Low_'s Men, who, we may suppose, was forced into his Gang, was\\ndrinking with a Silver Tankard at one of the Ports, and took his\\nOpportunity to drop into the Boat among the _Portuguese_, and lye down in\\nthe Bottom, in order to escape along with them: After he had stowed himself\\nin the Boat, so as not to be seen, it came into his Head, that the Tankard\\nmight prove of some Use to him, where he was going; so he got up again,\\nlaid hold of the Utensil, and went off, without being discover'd: In which\\nAttempt had he failed, no doubt his Life, if not the Lives of all the\\nPeople in the Boat, would have paid for it: The Name of this Man is\\n_Richard Hains._\\n\\n_Low_ took his old Tour to the _Canaries, Cape de Verd_ Islands, and so to\\nthe Coast of _Guiney_; but nothing extraordinary happened till they arrived\\nnear _Sierraleon_ in _Africa_, where they met with a Ship call'd the\\n_Delight_, Captain _Hunt_ Commander; this Ship they thought fit for their\\nown Purpose, for she had been a small Man of War, and carried 12 Guns;\\nhowever, they mounted 16 on Board her, mann'd her with 60 Men, and\\nappointed one _Spriggs_, who was then their Quarter-Master, to be Captain\\nof her, who, two Days after, separated from the Admiral, and went to the\\n_West-Indies_ a-pyrating, upon his own, and particular Company's, Account,\\nwhere for the present we shall leave him.\\n\\nIn _January_ last, _Low_ took a Ship, called the _Squirrel_, Captain\\n_Stephenson_; but what became of him afterwards, I can't tell; we have had\\nno News concerning him come to _England_, since this I have now mentioned;\\nbut I have heard that he talk'd of going to _Brazil_; and if so, it is\\nlikely we may too soon hear of some Exploit or other; tho' the best\\nInformation we could receive, would be, that he and all his Crew were at\\nthe Bottom of the Sea.\\n\\nCHAP. XIV. OF Capt. _JOHN EVANS_, And his CREW.\\n\\nJ_OHN Evans_ was a _Welch_ Man, had been formerly Master of a Sloop\\nbelonging to _Nevis_, but losing his Employ there, he sailed for some Time\\nout of _Jamaica_ as Mate, till happening in Company of three or four of his\\nComrades, and Wages not being so good as formerly, and Births scarce,\\nbecause of the great Number of Seamen; they agreed to go abroad in search\\nof Adventures. They sailed, or rather rowed out of _Port Royal_ in\\n_Jamaica_, the latter End of _September_ 1722, in a Canoa; and coming on\\nthe North-Side of the Island, went ashore in the Night, broke open a House\\nor two, and robb'd them of some Money, and every Thing else they could find\\nthat was portable, and brought the Booty on Board the Canoa.\\n\\nThis was very well for the first Time, but this kind of Robbery did not\\nplease so well, they wanted to get out to Sea, but having no Vessel but\\ntheir Canoa, they were prevented in their laudable Design; however, they\\nkept a good look out, and traversed the Island, in Expectation that\\nProvidence would send some unfortunate Vessel as a Sacrifice, and in a few\\nDays their Wishes were accomplished; for at _Duns Hole_, they found a small\\nSloop at an Anchor, belonging to _Bermudas_: They made bold and went\\naboard, and _Evans_ informed the Folks that belonged to her, that he was\\nCaptain of the Vessel, which was a Piece of News they knew not before.\\nAfter they had put their Affairs in a proper Disposition aboard, they went\\nashore to a little Village for Refreshments, and lived jovially the\\nremaining Part of the Day, at a Tavern, spending three Pistols, and then\\ndeparted. The People of the House admired at the merry Guests they had got,\\nwere mightily pleased, and wished for their Company at another Time, which\\nhappened too soon for their Profit; for, in the middle of the Night, they\\ncame ashore all Hands, rifled the House, and carried what they could aboard\\ntheir Sloop.\\n\\nThe next Day they weighed in the Sloop, aboard of which they mounted four\\nGuns, called her the _Scowerer_, and sailed to _Hispaniola_; on the North\\nPart of which Island they took a _Spanish_ Sloop, which proved an\\nextraordinary rich Prize, as it fell among so few Persons as this Company\\nconsisted of, for they shared upwards of 150 _l._ a Man.\\n\\nIn Pursuance of the Game, and beating up for the Windward Islands, the\\n_Scowerer_ met with a Ship from _New-England_, bound to _Jamaica_, 120\\nTons, called the _Dove_, Captain _Diamond_ Master, off _Porto Rico_: They\\nplundered her, and strengthened their own Company, by taking out the Mate,\\nand two or three other Men; they discharged the Prize, and run into one of\\nthe Islands for fresh Water and Necessaries, and staid there some Time.\\n\\nThe next Prize they made, was the _Lucretia and Catherine_, Captain\\n_Mills_, of 200 Ton Burthen; they came up with her near the Island\\n_Disseada, January_ 11th. Upon seizing of this Ship, the Pyrates began to\\ntake upon themselves the Distribution of Justice, examining the Men\\nconcerning their Master's Usage of them, according to the Custom of other\\nPyrates; but the Captain over-hearing the Matter, put an End to the\\njudicial Proceedings, and fell to rumaging the Ship, saying to them, _What\\nhave we to do to turn Reformers, 'tis Money we want?_ And speaking to the\\nPrisoners, he asked them, _Does your Captain give you Victuals enough?_ And\\nthey answering in the Affirmative: _Why then_, said he, _he ought to give\\nyou Work enough._\\n\\nAfter the taking of this Prize, they went to the little Island of _Avis_,\\nwith a Design to clean, and carried the _Lucretia_ along with them, in\\norder to heave down the _Scowerer_ by her; but meeting there with a Sloop,\\nthe Pyrate gave Chace till the Evening, when she was within Gun-Shot of\\nher; but fearing to lose Company with the _Lucretia_, who was a heavy\\nSailor, they left off, and saw her no more. This Chace brought them to\\nLeeward of their Port, so that they were obliged to look out for another\\nPlace of Retreat, and the Island of _Ruby_ not being far distant, they\\nsteered for that, and anchored there accordingly; but the next Day a\\n_Dutch_ Sloop coming as it were, into their Mouths, they could not forbear\\ndealing, and so making her their Prize, they plundered her of what came,\\nwhen shared, to fifty Pounds a Man.\\n\\nThey found this Sloop more for their Purpose than the _Lucretia_, to clean\\ntheir own Sloop by, as being much lower in the Wast, and therefore capable\\nof heaving her Bottom farther out of the Water, so she was discharged, and\\nthe _Dutch_ Man kept in her Room; but not thinking it convenient to lay up\\nhere, for fear a discovery should be made, they turned their Thoughts\\nanother Way, and steered to the Coast of _Jamaica_, where they took a Sugar\\nDrover, and then run to the _Grand Caimanes_, about 30 Leagues to Leeward\\nof _Jamaica_, with Intention to clean there; but an unhappy Accident put an\\nEnd to their Pyracies, which hitherto had proved very successful to them.\\n\\nThe Boatswain of the Pyrate being a noisy surly Fellow, the Captain had at\\nseveral Times Words with him, relating to his Behaviour, who thinking\\nhimself ill treated, not only returned ill Language, but also challenged\\nthe Captain to fight him on the next Shore they came to, with Pistols and\\nSword, as is the Custom among these Outlaws. When the Sloop arrived, as\\nabovementioned, the Captain proposed the Duel; but the cowardly Boatswain\\nrefused to fight, or go ashore, tho' it was his own Challenge. When Captain\\n_Evans_ saw there was nothing to be done with him, he took his Cane, and\\ngave him a hearty drubbing; but the Boatswain not being able to bear such\\nan Indignity, drew out a Pistol and shot _Evans_ thro' the Head, so that he\\nfell down dead; and the Boatswain immediately jumped over-board, and swam\\ntowards the Shore; but the Boat was quickly mann'd and sent after him,\\nwhich took him up and brought him aboard.\\n\\nThe Death of the Captain in that Manner, provoked all the Crew, and they\\nresolved the Criminal should die by the most exquisite Tortures; but while\\nthey were considering of the Punishment, the Gunner, transported with\\nPassion, discharged a Pistol, and shot him thro' the Body; but not killing\\nhim outright, the Delinquent in very moving Words, desired a Week for\\nRepentance only; but another stepping up to him, told him, _that he should\\nrepent and be damned to him_, and without more ado shot him dead.\\n\\nI should have observed, that when the _Lucretia_ and _Katharine_ was\\nsuffered to go away, the Pyrates detained their Mate, who was now the only\\nMan aboard, who understood Navigation, and him they desired to take upon\\nhim the Command of the Sloop, in the Room of Captain _Evans_ deceased; but\\nhe desired to be excused that Honour, and at length positively refused it;\\nso they agreed to break up the Company, and leave the Mate in Possession of\\nthe Vessel: Accordingly they went ashore at the _Caimanes_, carrying with\\nthem about nine thousand Pounds among thirty Persons; and it being fair\\nWeather, the Mate and a Boy brought the Vessel into _Port Royal_, in\\n_Jamaica._\\n\\nCHAP. XV. OF Captain _John Phillips_, And his CREW.\\n\\nJ_OHN Phillips_ was bred a Carpenter, and sailing to _Newfoundland_\\nin a West-Country Ship, was taken by _Anstis_ in the _Good Fortune_\\nBrigantine, the next Day after he had left his Consort and Commadore,\\nCaptain _Roberts. Phillips_ was soon reconciled to the Life of a Pyrate,\\nand being a brisk Fellow, was appointed Carpenter of the Vessel, for at\\nfirst his Ambition reach'd no higher; there he remain'd till they broke up\\nat _Tabago_, and was one of those who came home in a Sloop that we have\\nmentioned to be sunk in _Bristol_ Channel.\\n\\nHis Stay was not long in _England_, for whilst he was paying his first\\nVisits to his Friends in _Devonshire_, he heard of the Misfortune of some\\nof his Companions, that is, of their being taken and committed to _Bristol_\\nGoal; and there being good Reason for his apprehending Danger from a Wind\\nthat blew from the same Quarter, he mov'd off immediately to _Topsham_, the\\nnearest Port, and there shipp'd himself with one Captain _Wadham_, for a\\nVoyage to _Newfoundland_, and home again; which, by the way, Mr. _Phillips_\\nnever design'd to perform, or to see _England_ any more. When the Ship came\\nto _Peter_ Harbour in _Newfoundland_ aforesaid, he ran away from her, and\\nhired himself a Splitter in the Fishery, for the Season: But this was only\\ntill he could have an Opportunity of prosecuting his intended Rogueries; in\\norder to which, he combined with several others, in the same Employ, to go\\noff with one of the Vessels that lay in the Harbour, upon the pyratical\\nAccount; accordingly the Time was fix'd, _viz._ the 29th of _August_ 1723,\\nat Night; but whether Remorse or Fear prevented their coming together, I\\nknow not, but of sixteen Men that were in the Combination, five only kept\\nthe Appointment: Notwithstanding which, _Phillips_ was for pushing forward\\nwith that small Number, assuring his Companions, that they should soon\\nencrease their Company; and they agreeing, a Vessel was seiz'd on, and out\\nof the Harbour they sailed.\\n\\nThe first Thing they had now to do, was to chuse Officers, draw up\\nArticles, and settle their little Commonwealth, to prevent Disputes and\\nRanglings afterwards; so _John Phillips_ was made Captain, _John Nutt_,\\nMaster, (or Navigator) of the Vessel; _James Sparks_, Gunner; _Thomas\\nFern_, Carpenter; and _Wiliam White_ was the only private Man in the whole\\nCrew: When this was done, one of them writ out the following Articles\\n(which we have taken _verbatim_) and all swore to 'em upon a Hatchet for\\nwant of a Bible.\\n\\nThe Articles on Board the _Revenge._\\n\\n1.\\n\\nE_Very Man shall obey civil Command; the Captain shall have one full\\nShare and a half in all Prizes; the Master, Carpenter, Boatswain and Gunner\\nshall have one Share and quarter._\\n\\n2.\\n\\n_If any Man shall offer to run away, or keep any Secret from the Company,\\nhe shall be marroon'd, with one Bottle of Powder, one Bottle of Water, one\\nsmall Arm, and Shot._\\n\\n3.\\n\\n_If any Man shall steal any Thing in the Company, or game, to the Value of\\na Piece of Eight, he shall be marroon'd or shot._\\n\\n4.\\n\\n_If at any Time we should meet another Marrooner_ [_that is, _Pyrate,]\\n_that Man that shall sign his Articles without the Consent of our company,\\nshall suffer such Punishment as the Captain and Company shall think fit._\\n\\n5.\\n\\n_That Man that shall strike another whilst these Articles are in force,\\nshall receive_ Moses_'s Law_ (_that is_, 40 _Stripes lacking one_) _on the\\nbare Back._\\n\\n6.\\n\\n_That Man that shall snap his Arms, or smoak Tobacco in the Hold, without a\\nCap to his Pipe, or carry a Candle lighted without a Lanthorn, shall suffer\\nthe same Punishment as in the former Article._\\n\\n7.\\n\\n_That Man that shall not keep his Arms clean, fit for an Engagement, or\\nneglect his Business, shall be cut off from his Share, and suffer such\\nother Punishment as the Captain and the Company shall think fit._\\n\\n8.\\n\\n_If any Man shall lose a Joint in time of an Engagement, shall have_ 400\\n_Pieces of Eight; if a Limb_, 800.\\n\\n9.\\n\\n_If at any time you meet with a prudent Woman, that Man that offers to\\nmeddle with her, without her Consent, shall suffer present Death._\\n\\nThus prepar'd, this bold Crew set out, and before they left the Banks they\\nmade Prize of several small Fishing-Vessels, out of which they got a few\\nHands, some _French_ and some _English_, and then sail'd for the\\n_West-Indies_; in one of these Vessels they took out one _John Rose\\nArcher_, who having been a Pyrate under the famous _Black-beard_, was\\nimmediately preferr'd over other People's Heads, to be Quarter-Master to\\nthe Company; which sudden Promotion so disgusted some of the older\\nStanders, especially _Fern_, the Carpenter, that it occasioned some\\nMischief to follow, as we shall shew by and by.\\n\\nThe Pyrates came off _Barbadoes_ the beginning of _October_, and cruised\\nthere, and among other Islands, above three Months, without speaking with a\\nVessel, so that they were almost starv'd for want of Provisions, being\\nreduc'd to a Pound of Meat a Day between ten; at length they fell in with a\\n_Martinico_ Man of 12 Guns and 35 Hands, far superior in Force, and what\\nthey would not have ventur'd on at another Time, but _Hunger will break\\ndown Stone Walls_; they were resolved to shew the _French_ Men their black\\nFlag; and if that would not do, they must seek out elsewhere; accordingly,\\nthey boldly ran up a-long-side of the Sloop, with their pyratical Colours\\nflying, and told them, if they did not strike immediately, they would give\\nthem no Quarters; which so intimidated the _Frenchmen_, that they never\\nfired a Gun. This proved a seasonable Supply; they took her Provisions, and\\nfour of her Men, and let her go. They took presently after, a Sloop\\nbelonging to _New-York_, and a _Virginia_ Man, _Huffam_ Master.\\n\\nHaving now occasion to clean their Vessel, _Phillips_ propos'd _Tobago_,\\nwhere the Company he formerly belong'd to, under _Anstis_ and _Fenn_, broke\\nup; to induce them to it, he told them when he left the Island, there was\\nleft behind six or eight of their Company that were not willing to go to\\n_England_, with three Negroes: Whereupon they sail'd to the Island, and\\nafter a careful Search, found only one of the Negroes, whose Name was\\n_Pedro_, who inform'd Captain _Phillips_, that those that were left behind\\nwere taken by a Man of War's Crew, and hang'd at _Antegoa_, among whom was\\n_Fenn_, their Captain.\\n\\nThey took _Pedro_ on Board, and then fell to Business, careening their\\nVessel; and just as they had finished their Work, a Man of War's Boat came\\ninto the Harbour, the Ship being cruising to Leeward of the Island. It was\\neasily guess'd upon what Errant she was sent, and therefore they lost no\\nTime, but, as soon as the Boat went away, warp'd out, and ply'd to Windward\\nfor Security, but left the four _French_ Men, they took out of the\\n_Martinico_ Sloop, behind.\\n\\nIn a few Days they took a Snow with a few Hands, and _Fern_, the Carpenter,\\none _William Phillips, Wood_ and _Taylor_, went aboard to take Possession\\nof her. _Fern_, not forgetting the Affront of having _Archer_ preferr'd\\nbefore him, resolv'd to go off with the Prize, and brought the rest into\\nthe same Measures; however _Phillips_, the Captain, keeping a good\\nLook-out, perceiv'd their Design, and gave them Chace, who coming up with\\nthe Vessel, a Skirmish ensu'd, wherein _Wood_ was kill'd and _Taylor_\\nwounded in his Leg; upon which the other two surrender'd. There was no\\nSurgeon aboard, and therefore it was advis'd, upon a learned Consultation,\\nthat _Phillips_'s Leg should be cut off; but who should perform the\\nOperation was the Dispute; at length the Carpenter was appointed, as the\\nmost proper Man: Upon which, he fetch'd up the biggest Saw, and taking the\\nLimb under his Arm, fell to Work, and separated it from the Body of the\\nPatient, in as little Time as he could have cut a Deal Board in two; after\\nthat he heated his Ax red hot in the Fire, and cauteriz'd the Wound, but\\nnot with so much Art as he perform'd the other Part, for he so burnt his\\nFlesh distant from the Place of Amputation, that it had like to have\\nmortify'd; however nature perform'd a Cure at last without any other\\nAssistance.\\n\\nFrom _Tobago_ they stood away to the Northward and took a _Portugueze_\\nbound for _Brazil_, and two or three Sloops from _Jamaica_, in one of\\nwhich, _Fern_ the Carpenter, endeavouring to go off, was kill'd by\\n_Phillips_ the Captain, pursuant to their Articles; another had the same\\nFate some Days after for the like Attempt. These Severities made it\\ndangerous for any to consult or project an Escape; the Terror of which made\\nseveral sign their Articles and set down quietly, waiting impatiently for\\nRedemption, which as yet they saw no great likelyhood of, and should they\\nhave been taken before such Circumstances appear'd in their Actions or\\nCharacters, as afterwards happen'd, to denote their Innocence, they might\\nhave lost their Lives upon a Tryal at a Court of Admiralty; for pretty\\nstrong Evidence is expected in their Favour, to ballance that of being\\ntaken aboard a Vessel which is prov'd to be in actual Pyracy, and they\\nassisting therein.\\n\\nThus was many an honest Man's Case made most desperate by the consummate\\nVillany of a few hardned Wretches, who fear neither God or Devil, as this\\n_Phillips_ us'd often blasphemously to express himself.\\n\\nOn the 25th of _March_ they took two Ships from _Virginia_ for _London,\\nJohn Phillips_, the Pyrate Captain's Namesake, was Master of one, and\\nCaptain _Robert Mortimer_, the other, a brisk young Fellow, that deserv'd a\\nbetter Fate than he met with. _Phillips_ the Pyrate staid on Board of\\nCaptain _Mortimer_'s Ship, while they transported the Crew to the Sloop,\\nand the Boat returning along side, one of the Pyrates therein calls to\\n_Phillips_, and tells him, there was a Mutiny aboard their Vessel,\\n_Mortimer_ had two Men in his Ship, and the Pyrate Captain had two,\\ntherefore thought it a good Opportunity to recover his Ship, and directly\\ntook up a Handspike and struck _Phillips_ over the Head, giving him a\\ndangerous wound, but not knocking him down, he recovered and wounded\\n_Mortimer_ with his Sword; and the two Pyrates that were aboard coming in\\nto Captain _Phillips_'s Assistance, Captain _Mortimer_ was presently cut to\\nPieces, while his own two Men stood by and did nothing.\\n\\nThis was the first Voyage that _Mortimer_ had the Command of a Vessel, by\\nwhose Death is a poor disconsolate Widow made miserable, more in regard of\\nthe mutual Love and Fidelity they lived in, than the Loss of what would\\nhave been a handsome and comfortable Provision for themselves and Children,\\nwhich, I think, now ought to be made up by the Publick, since 'twas in the\\npublick Service he fell; for had his Attempt succeeded, in all Probability\\nhe would not only have regained his own Ship, but entirely subdued and\\ndestroy'd the Enemy, there being several, as it afterwards proved, that\\nwould have seconded such an Enterprize when ever they found a Beginning\\nmade.\\n\\nThis Affair ended without any other Consequence than a strict Search after\\na Brother of Captain _Mortimer_, who was on Board, in order to have put him\\nlikewise to death; but he had the good Fortune to meet with a Townsman\\namong the Crew, who hid him for four and twenty Hours in a Stay-Sail, till\\nthe Heat of their Fury was over, and by that Means happily missed of the\\nFate designed him.\\n\\nOut of the other _Virginia_ Man before spoken of, they took one _Edward\\nCheeseman_, a Carpenter, to supply the Place of their late Carpenter,\\n_Fern._ He was a modest sober young Man, very averse to their unlawful\\nPractice, and a brave gallant Fellow. There was one _John Philmore_ of\\n_Ipswich_, formerly taken by them, ordered to row _Cheeseman_ aboard of\\n_Mortimer_'s Ship, which the Pyrates possess'd themselves of, who, seeing\\nwith what Reluctance and Uneasiness _Cheeseman_ was brought away, told him,\\nhe would join with him, in some Measures, to over-throw the pyratical\\nGovernment, telling him withal, their present Condition, what Difficulties\\n_Phillips_ had met with to make up his Company, and how few voluntary\\nPyrates there were on Board, and the like. But, however specious this\\nseemed, _Cheeseman_ out of Prudence rejected his Offers of Assistance, till\\nhe saw some Proofs of his Sincerity, which after a few Days he was\\nconvinced of, and then they often consulted; but as the old Pyrates were\\nalways jealous of the new Comers, and consequently observant of their\\nBehaviour; this was done with the utmost Caution, chiefly when they were\\nlying down together, as tho' asleep, and, at other Times, when they were\\nplaying at Cards; both which they feigned often to do for that Purpose.\\n\\nThe Pyrates went on all the while, plundering and robbing several Ships and\\nVessels, bending their Course towards _Newfoundland_, where they designed\\nto raise more Men, and do all the Mischief they could on the Banks, and in\\nthe Harbours.\\n\\n_Newfoundland_ is an Island on the North Continent of _America_, contained\\nbetween the 46 and 53° of N. Latitude, discovered first by St. _Sebastion\\nCabot_ A. D. 1497, but never settled till the Year 1610; when Mr. _Guy_ of\\n_Bristol_ revived the Affair, and obtained a Patent, and himself to be\\nGovernor. The Island is deserted by the Natives and neglected by us, being\\ndesolate and Woody, and the Coast and Harbour only held for the Conveniency\\nof the Cod Fishery, for which alone they were settled.\\n\\nThe Bays and Harbours about it, are very numerous and convenient, and being\\ndeeply indented, makes it easy for any Intelligence quickly to pass from\\none Harbour to another over Land; especially the principal, St. _John_'s\\nand _Placentia_, when the Appearance of an Enemy makes them apprehend\\nDanger.\\n\\nThey are able to cure and export about 100000 Quintals (100 Weight each) of\\nFish, annually, which returns to _England_ in Money, or the necessary\\nCommodities of _Portugal, Spain_ and _Italy._ As it therefore expends\\nabundance of Rum, Molossus and Sugar, the Product of our _West-India_\\nColonies, and employs a Number of Fishermen from home every Season, by\\nwhose Industry and Labour only this Fish is purchased, it may very well be\\nreckon'd an advantagious Branch of Trade.\\n\\nBut the present Design of this Digression being not to give an exact\\nDescription of the Country or Fishery; but rather how it accidentally\\ncontributes to raise, or support the Pyrates already rais'd, I shall\\nobserve,\\n\\nFirst, That our West Country Fishing-Ships, _viz._ from _Topsham,\\nBarnstable_ and _Bristol_, who chiefly attend the Fishing Seasons,\\ntransport over a considerable Number of poor Fellows every Summer, whom\\nthey engage at low Wages, and are by their Terms to pay for Passage back to\\n_England._ When the _Newfoundland_ Ships left that Country, towards Winter,\\nin the Year 1720, these Passengers muster'd 1100, who, during the Season of\\nBusiness, (the Hardness of their Labour, and Chilness of the Nights,\\npinching them very much) are mostly fond of drinking Black Strap, (a strong\\nLiquor used there, and made from Rum, Molossus, and Chowder Beer;) by this\\nthe Majority of them out-run the Constable, and then are necessitated to\\ncome under hard Articles of Servitude for their Maintenance in the Winter;\\nno ordinary Charge, indeed, when the Barrenness of the Country is\\nconsider'd, and the Stock of Provision laid in, happen to fall short, in\\nProportion to the Computation made of the People remaining there the\\nWinter, which are generally about 17 or 1800. The Masters residing there\\nthink Advantages taken on their Necessities, no more than a just and lawful\\nGain; and either bind such for the next Summer's Service, or sell their\\nProvisions out to them at extravagant Rates; Bread from 15s. to 50,\\nimmediately at the departing of the Ships, and so of other sorts of Food in\\nProportion; wherefore not being able to subsist themselves, or in any\\nlikely Way of clearing the Reckoning to the Masters, they sometimes run\\naway with Shallops and Boats, and begin on pyratical Exploits, as\\n_Phillips_ and his Companions, whom we are now treating of, had done.\\n\\nAnd secondly (which is more opportunely for them,) they are visited every\\nSummer, almost, by some Set of Pyrates or other, already rais'd, who call\\nhere for the same Purpose, (if young Beginners) and to lay in a Store of\\nWater and Provisions, which they find imported, much or little, by all the\\nShips that use the Trade.\\n\\nTowards this Country _Phillips_ was making his Way, and took on the Voyage,\\nbesides those abovementioned, one _Salter_, in a Sloop off the Isle of\\n_Sables_, which Vessel they made use of themselves, and gave back\\n_Mortimer_'s Ship to the Mate and Crew. The same Day, _viz._ the 4th of\\n_April_, took a Scooner, one _Chadwell_, Master, which they scuttled, in\\norder to sink; but Capt. _Phillips_ understanding that she belong'd to Mr.\\n_Minors_ at _Newfoundland_, with whose Vessel they first went off a\\npyrating, a Qualm of Conscience came athwart his Stomach, and he said to\\nhis Companions, _We have done him Injury enough already_; so order'd the\\nVessel immediately to be repair'd, and return'd her to the Master.\\n\\nThat Afternoon they chac'd another Vessel, and at Night came up with her,\\nthe Master of which was a Saint of _New-England_, nam'd _Dependance\\nEllery_, who taking _Phillips_ for a Pyrate, he told him was the Reason\\nthat he gave him the Trouble of chacing so long; which being resented by\\nthese Men of Honour, they made poor _Dependance_ dance about the Deck till\\nhe was weary.\\n\\nWithin few Days several other Vessels had the same Misfortune, the Masters\\nNames were as follow, _Joshua Elwell, Samuel Elwell_, Mr. _Combs_, Mr.\\n_Lansly, James Babston, Edward Freeman_, Mr. _Start, Obediah Beal, Erick\\nErickson_ and _Benjamin Wheeler._\\n\\nThe 14th of _April_ they took a Sloop belonging to Cape _Ann, Andrew\\nHarradine_ Master; they look'd upon this Vessel more fit for their Purpose,\\nand so came aboard, keeping only the Master of her Prisoner, and sending\\n_Harradine_'s Crew away in _Salter_'s Vessel, which they, till this Time,\\ndetain'd. To this _Harradine, Cheeseman_ the Carpenter, broke his Mind, and\\nbrought him into the Confederacy to destroy the Crew, which was put in\\nExecution four Days afterwards.\\n\\n_Harradine_ and the rest were for doing the Business in the Night, as\\nbelieving they might be more opportunely surpriz'd; for _Nut_, the Master,\\nbeing a Fellow of great Strength, and no less Courage, it was thought\\ndangerous to attack him without Fire-Arms; however, _Cheeseman_ was\\nresolute to have it perform'd by Day-light, as the least liable to\\nConfusion; and as to the Master, he offer'd to lay Hands on him first: Upon\\nthis 'twas concluded on, 12 at Noon was the appointed Time; in order for\\nthe Business _Cheeseman_ leaves his working Tools on the Deck, as though he\\nhad been going to use them, and walked aft; but perceiving some Signs of\\nTimidity in _Harradine_, he comes back, fetches his Brandy Bottle and gives\\nhim and the rest a Dram, then drank to _Burril_, the Boatswain, and the\\nMaster, _To their next merry Meeting_, and up he puts the Bottle; then he\\ntakes a Turn with _Nut_, asking what he thought of the Weather, and such\\nlike. In the mean while _Filemore_ takes up the Axe, and turns it round\\nupon the Point, as if at Play, then both he and _Harradine_ wink at him,\\nthereby letting him know they were ready; upon which Signal he seizes _Nut_\\nby the Collar, with one Hand between his Legs, and toss'd him over the Side\\nof the Vessel, but, he holding by _Cheeseman_'s Sleeve, said, _Lord have\\nMercy upon me! what are you going to do, Carpenter?_ He told him it was an\\nunnecessary Question, _For_, says he, _Master, you are a dead Man_, so\\nstrikes him over the Arm, _Nut_ looses his Hold, tumbles into the Sea, and\\nnever spoke more.\\n\\nBy this time the Boatswain was dead; for as soon as _Filemore_ saw the\\nMaster laid hold of, he raised up the Axe, and divided his Enemy's Head in\\ntwo: The Noise brought the Captain upon Deck, whom _Cheeseman_ saluted with\\nthe Blow of a Mallet, which broke his Jaw-Bone, but did not knock him down;\\n_Harradine_ came in then with the Carpenter's Adds, but _Sparks_, the\\nGunner, interposing between him and Captain _Phillips, Cheeseman_ trips up\\nhis Heels, and flung him into the Arms of _Charles Ivymay_, one of his\\nConsorts, who that Instant discharg'd him into the Sea; and at the same\\nTime _Harradine_ compassed his Business with the Captain aforesaid:\\n_Cheeseman_ lost no Time, but from the Deck jumps into the Hold, and was\\nabout to beat out the Brains of _Archer_, the Quarter-Master, having struck\\nhim two or three Blows with his blunt Weapon the Mallet, when _Harry\\nGiles_, a young Lad, came down after him, and desir'd his Life might be\\nspar'd, as an Evidence of their own Innocence; that he having all the Spoil\\nand Plunder in his Custody, it may appear, that these tragick Proceedings\\nwere not undertaken with any dishonest View of seizing or appropriating the\\nEffects to themselves; which prudent Advice prevail'd, and he and three\\nmore were made Prisoners, and secured.\\n\\nThe Work being done, they went about Ship, altered the Course from\\n_Newfoundland_ to _Boston_, and arrived safe the 3d of _May_ following, to\\nthe great Joy of that Province.\\n\\nOn the 12th of _May_, 1724, a special Court of Admiralty was held for the\\nTryal of these Pyrates, when _John Filmore, Edward Cheeseman, John Combs,\\nHenry Giles, Charles Ivymay, John Bootman_, and _Henry Payne_, the seven\\nthat confederated together for the Pyrates Destruction, were honourably\\nacquitted; as also three _French_ Men, _John Baptis, Peter Taffery_, and\\n_Isaac Lassen_, and three Negroes, _Pedro, Francisco_, and _Pierro._ And\\n_John Rose Archer_, the Quarter-Master, _William White, William Taylor_,\\nand _William Phillips_, were condemned; the two latter were reprieved for a\\nYear and a Day, in order to be recommended (though I don't know for what)\\nas Objects of his Majesty's Mercy. The two former were executed on the 2d\\nof _June_, and dy'd very penitently, making the following Declarations at\\nthe Place of Execution, with the Assistance of two grave Divines that\\nattended them.\\n\\n_The dying Declarations of_ John Rose Archer _and_ William White, _on\\nthe Day of their Execution at_ Boston, June 2, 1724, _for the Crimes of\\nPyracy._\\n\\nFirst, separately, of _Archer._\\n\\nI Greatly bewail my Profanations of the Lord's Day, and my\\nDisobedience to my Parents.\\n\\nAnd my Cursing and Swearing, and my blaspheming the Name of the glorious\\nGod.\\n\\nUnto which I have added, the Sins of Unchastity. And I have provoked the\\nHoly One, at length, to leave me unto the Crimes of Pyracy and Robbery;\\nwherein, at last, I have brought my self under the Guilt of Murder also.\\n\\nBut one Wickedness that has led me as much as any, to all the rest, has\\nbeen my brutish Drunkenness. By strong Drink I have been heated and\\nhardened into the Crimes that are now more bitter than Death unto me.\\n\\nI could wish that Masters of Vessels would not use their Men with so much\\nSeverity, as many of them do, which exposes to great Temptations.\\n\\nAnd then of _White._\\n\\nI am now, with Sorrow, reaping the Fruits of my Disobedience to my Parents,\\nwho used their Endeavours to have me instructed in my Bible, and my\\nCatechism.\\n\\nAnd the Fruits of my neglecting the publick Worship of God, and prophaning\\nthe holy Sabbath.\\n\\nAnd of my blaspheming the Name of God, my Maker.\\n\\nBut my Drunkenness has had a great Hand in bringing my Ruin upon me. I was\\ndrunk when I was enticed aboard the Pyrate.\\n\\nAnd now, for all the vile Things I did aboard, I own the Justice of God and\\nMan, in what is done unto me.\\n\\nOf both together.\\n\\nWe hope, we truly hate the Sins, whereof we have the Burthen lying so heavy\\nupon our Consciences.\\n\\nWe warn all People, and particularly young People, against such Sins as\\nthese. We wish, all may take Warning by us.\\n\\nWe beg for Pardon, for the sake of Christ, our Saviour; and our Hope is in\\nhim alone. Oh! _that in his Blood our Scarlet and Crimson Guilt may be all\\nwashed away!_\\n\\nWe are sensible of an hard Heart in us, full of Wickedness. And we look\\nupon God for his renewing Grace upon us.\\n\\nWe bless God for the Space of Repentance which he has given us; and that he\\nhas not cut us off in the Midst and Heighth of our Wickedness.\\n\\nWe are not without Hope, that God has been savingly at work upon our Souls.\\n\\nWe are made sensible of our absolute Need of the Righteousness of Christ;\\nthat we may stand justified before God in that. We renounce all Dependance\\non our own.\\n\\nWe are humbly thankful to the Ministers of Christ, for the great Pains they\\nhave taken for our Good. The Lord Reward their Kindness.\\n\\nWe don't Despair of Mercy; but hope, through Christ, that when we dye, we\\nshall find Mercy with God, and be received into his Kingdom.\\n\\nWe wish others, and especially the Sea-faring, may get Good by what they\\nsee this Day befalling of us.\\n\\n_Declared in the Presence of_ J. W. D. M.\\n\\nCHAP. XVI. OF Captain _SPRIGGS_, And his CREW.\\n\\nS_Priggs_ sailed with _Low_ for a pretty while, and I believe came\\naway from _Lowther_, along with him; he was Quarter-Master to the Company,\\nand consequently had a great Share in all the Barbarities committed by that\\nexecrable Gang, till the Time they parted; which was about _Christmas_\\nlast, when _Low_ took a Ship of 12 Guns on the Coast of _Guiney_, called\\nthe _Delight_, (formerly the _Squirrel_ Man of War,) commanded by Captain\\n_Hunt. Spriggs_ took Possession of the Ship with eighteen Men, left _Low_\\nin the Night, and came to the _West-Indies._ This Separation was occasioned\\nby a Quarrel with _Low_, concerning a Piece of Justice _Spriggs_ would have\\nexecuted upon one of the Crew, for killing a Man in cold Blood, as they\\ncall it, one insisting that he should be hang'd, and the other that he\\nshould not.\\n\\nA Day or two after they parted, _Spriggs_ was chose Captain by the rest,\\nand a black Ensign was made, which they called _Jolly Roger_, with the same\\nDevice that Captain _Low_ carried, _viz._ a white Skeliton in the Middle of\\nit, with a Dart in one Hand striking a bleeding Heart, and in the other, an\\nHour-Glass; when this was finished and hoisted, they fired all their Guns\\nto salute their Captain and themselves, and then looked out for Prey.\\n\\nIn their Voyage to the _West-Indies_, these Pyrates took a _Portuguese_\\nBark, wherein they got valuable Plunder, but not contented with that alone,\\nthey said they would have a little Game with the Men, and so ordered them a\\nSweat, more for the Brutes Diversion, than the poor Men's Healths; which\\nOperation is performed after this Manner; they stick up lighted Candles\\ncircularly round the Mizon-Mast, between Decks, within which the Patients\\none at a Time enter; without the Candles, the Pyrates post themselves, as\\nmany as can stand, forming another Circle, and armed with Pen-Knives,\\nTucks, Forks, Compasses, _&c._ and as he runs round and round, the Musick\\nplaying at the same Time, they prick him with those Instuments; this\\nusually lasts for 10 or 12 Minutes, which is as long as the miserable Man\\ncan support himself. When the Sweating was over, they gave the _Portuguese_\\ntheir Boat with a small Quantity of Provisions, and set their Vessel on\\nFire.\\n\\nNear the Island of St. _Lucia_, they took a Sloop belonging to _Barbadoes_,\\nwhich they plundered, and then burnt, forcing some of the Men to sign their\\nArticles, the others they beat and cut in a barbarous Manner, because they\\nrefused to take on with the Crew, and then sent them away in the Boat, who\\nall got safe afterwards to _Barbadoes._\\n\\nThe next was a _Martinico_ Man, which they served as bad as they had done\\nthe others, but did not burn their Ship. Some Days afterwards in running\\ndown to Leeward, they took one Captain _Hawkins_, coming from _Jamaica_,\\nloaden chiefly with Logwood; they took out of her, Stores, Arms,\\nAmmunition, and several other Things, as they thought fit, and what they\\ndid not want they threw over-board or destroy'd; they cut the Cables to\\npieces, knocked down the Cabins, broke all the Windows, and in short took\\nall the Pains in the World to be Mischievous. They took by Force, out of\\nher, Mr. _Burridge_ and Mr. _Stephens_, the two Mates, and some other\\nHands; and after detaining the Ship from the 22d of _March_, to the 29th,\\nthey let her go. On the 27th they took a _Rhode Island_ Sloop, Captain\\n_Pike_, and all his Men were obliged to go aboard the Pyrate; but the Mate\\nbeing a grave sober Man, and not inclinable to stay, they told him, he\\nshould have his Discharge, and that it should be immediately writ on his\\nBack; whereupon he was sentenced to receive ten Lashes from every Man in\\nthe Ship, which was rigorously put in Execution.\\n\\nThe next Day Mr. _Burridge_, Captain _Hawkins_'s Mate, sign'd their\\nArticles, which was so agreeable to them (he being a good Artist and\\nSailor) that they gave three Huzza's, fir'd all the Guns in the Ship, and\\nappointed him Master: The Day was spent in boysterous Mirth, roaring and\\ndrinking of Healths, among which was, by Mistake, that of King _George_ the\\nII. for you must know, now and then the Gentry are provok'd to sudden Fits\\nof Loyalty, by the Expectation of an Act of Grace: It seems Captain _Pike_\\nhad heard at _Jamaica_ that the King was dead, so the Pyrates immediately\\nhoisted their Ensign Half-Mast (the Death Signal) and proclaim'd his Royal\\nHighness, saying, _They doubted not but there would be a general Pardon in\\na twelve Month, which they would embrace and come in upon, but damn 'em if\\nthey should be excepted out of it, they would murder every_ Englishman\\n_that should fall into their Hands._\\n\\nThe second of _April_, they spy'd a Sail, and gave her Chace till 12\\no'Clock at Night, the Pyrates believed her to be a _Spaniard_, when they\\ncame close up to her, they discharged a Broadside, with small and great\\nShot, which was follow'd by another, but the Ship making a lamentable Cry\\nfor Quarters, they ceas'd firing, and ordered the Captain to come aboard,\\nwhich he did, but how disappointed the Rogues were when they found 'twas\\ntheir old Friend Captain _Hawkins_, whom they had sent away three Days\\nbefore, worth not one Penny? This was such a Baulk to them, that they\\nresolved he should suffer for falling in their Way, tho' it was so contrary\\nto his own Inclinations: About 15 of them surrounded the poor Man with\\nsharp Cutlashes, and fell upon him, whereby he was soon laid flat on the\\nDeck; at that Instant _Burridge_ flew amongst the thickest of the Villains,\\nand begg'd earnestly for his Life, upon whose Request 'twas granted. They\\nwere now most of 'em drunk, as is usual at this Time of Night, so they\\nunanimously agreed to make a Bonfire of _Hawkins_'s Ship, which was\\nimmediately done, and in half an Hour she was all of a Blaze.\\n\\nAfter this, they wanted a little more Diversion, and so Captain _Hawkins_\\nwas sent for down to the Cabin to Supper; what should the Provision be, but\\na Dish of Candles, which he was forced to eat, having a naked Sword and a\\nPistol held to his Breast all the while; when this was over, they buffeted\\nhim about for some Time, and sent him forward amongst the other Prisoners,\\nwho had been treated with the same Delicacies.\\n\\nTwo Days afterwards, they anchor'd at a little uninhabited Island, call'd\\n_Rattan_, near the Bay of _Honduras_, and put ashore Captain _Hawkins_, and\\nseveral other Men, (one of them his Passenger) who dy'd there of the\\nHardships he underwent. They gave them Powder and Ball, and a Musquet, with\\nwhich they were to shift as they could, sailing away the next Day for other\\nAdventures.\\n\\nCaptain _Hawkins_, and his unfortunate Companions, staid 19 Days upon this\\nIsland, supplying themselves with both Fish and Fowl, such as they were, at\\nwhich Time came two Men in a Canoe, that had been left upon another marroon\\nIsland near _Benacca_, who carry'd the Company at several Times thither, it\\nbeing more convenient in having a good Well of fresh Water, and Plenty of\\nFish, _&c._ Twelve Days afterwards they spy'd a Sloop off at Sea, which,\\nupon their making a great Smoke, stood in, and took them off; she was the\\n_Merriam_, Captain _Jones_, lately escaped out of the Bay of _Honduras_,\\nfrom being taken by the _Spaniards._\\n\\nAt an Island to the Westward, the Pyrates clean'd their Ship, and sail'd\\ntowards the Island of St. _Christophers_, to wait for one Captain _Moor_,\\nwho commanded the _Eagle_ Sloop, when she took _Lowther_'s upon the Careen,\\nat _Blanco_; _Spriggs_ resolved to put him to Death, whenever he took him,\\nfor falling upon his Friend and Brother, but instead of _Moor_, he found a\\n_French_ Man of War from _Martinico_ upon the Coast, which _Spriggs_ not\\nthinking fit to contend with, run away with all the Sail he could make, the\\n_French_ Man crowded after him, and was very likely to speak with Mr.\\n_Spriggs_, when unfortunately his Main-Top-Mast came by the Board, which\\nobliged him to give over the Chace.\\n\\n_Spriggs_ then stood to the Northward, towards _Burmudas_, or the _Summer\\nIsles_, and took a Scooner belonging to _Boston_; he took out all the Men\\nand sunk the Vessel, and had the Impudence to tell the Master, that he\\ndesigned to encrease his Company on the Banks of _Newfoundland_, and then\\nwould sail for the Coast of _New-England_ in quest of Captain _Solgard_,\\nwho attack'd and took their Consort _Charles Harris, Spriggs_ being then in\\n_Low_'s Sloop, who very fairly run for it. The Pyrate ask'd the Master if\\nhe knew Captain _Solgard_, who answering No; he ask'd another the same\\nQuestion, and then a third, who said he knew him very well, upon which\\n_Spriggs_ ordered him to be sweated, which was done in the Manner before\\ndescrib'd.\\n\\nInstead of going to _Newfoundland_ as the Pyrates threat'ned, they came\\nback to the Islands, and to Windward of St. _Christophers_, on the 4th of\\n_June_ last, took a Sloop, _Nicholas Trot_ Master, belonging to St.\\n_Eustatia_, and wanting a little Diversion, they hoisted the Men as high as\\nthe Main and Fore Tops, and let them run down amain, enough to break all\\nthe Bones in their Skins, and after they had pretty well crippled them by\\nthis cruel Usage, and whipp'd them about the Deck, they gave _Trot_ his\\nSloop, and let him go, keeping back only 2 of his Men, besides the Plunder\\nof the Vessel.\\n\\nWithin two or three Days they took a Ship coming from _Rhode-Island_ to St.\\n_Christophers_, loaden with Provisions and some Horses; the Pyrates mounted\\nthe Horses and rid them about the Deck backwards and forwards a full\\nGallop, like Madmen at _New-Market_, cursing, swearing, and hallowing, at\\nsuch a Rate, that made the poor Creatures wild, and at length, two or three\\nof them throwing their Riders, they fell upon the Ship's Crew, and whipp'd,\\nand cut, and beat them in a barbarous Manner, telling them, it was for\\nbringing Horses without Boots and Spurs, for want of which they were not\\nable to ride them.\\n\\nThis is the last Account we have had of Captain _Spriggs_, I shall only add\\nthe two following Relations, and conclude.\\n\\nA Brigantine belonging to _Bristol_, one _Mr. Rowry_ Master, had been\\ntrading at _Gambia_, in _Africa_, and falling as low as Cape _Mount_, to\\nfinish the slaving of the Vessel, he had, by a Misfortune usual at that\\nPart of the Coast, his Mate, Surgeon, and two more of his Men,\\n_Panyarr_'d[*] by the Negroes. The Remainder of his Company, which was not\\nabove 5 or 6 in Number, took this Opportunity, and seiz'd the Vessel in the\\nRoad, making the Master Prisoner.\\n\\nYou will think it prodigious impudent that so small a Number should\\nundertake to proceed a pyrating, especially when neither of them had\\nsufficient Skill in Navigation: Yet this they did, leaving those People,\\ntheir Ship-Mates abovemention'd, to the Mercy of the barbarous Natives, and\\nsail'd away down the Coast, making them a black Flag, which they merrily\\nsaid, would be as good as 50 Men more, _i. e._ would carry as much Terror;\\nand that they did not doubt of soon increasing their Crew, to put them in\\nan enterprizing Capacity; but their vain Projection was soon happily\\nfrustrated, and after this Manner.\\n\\nThe Master whose Life they had preserved, (perhaps only for supplying their\\nown Unskillfulness in Navigation,) advised them, that since contrary to\\ntheir Expectations, they had met with no Ship between _Cape Mount_, and the\\n_Bite_ of _Calabar_, to proceed to the Island of St. _Thomas_'s, where they\\nmight recruit with Provisions and Water, and sell off the Slaves (about 70\\nof them) which they perceived would be a useless Lumber, and incommodious\\nto their Design. They arrived there in _August_ 1721, and one Evening,\\nwhile Part of them were on Shore, applying for this Purpose to the\\nGovernor, and the other Part carelesly from the Deck, Mr. _Rowry_ stepp'd\\ninto the Boat belonging to the Vessel, and pushed off, very suddenly: They\\nheard the Noise it made, and soon were upon Deck again, but having no other\\nBoat to pursue, nor a Musket, ready to fire, he got safe on Shore, and ran\\nto the Governor with his Complaint, who immediately imprisoned those\\nalready there, and sent a Launch off to take the rest out of the Ship.\\n\\nThe _Swallow_ arrived at St. _Thomas_'s the Beginning of _October_\\nfollowing, where, on Mr. _Rowry_'s Remonstrance, Application was made to\\nthe _Portuguese_ Governor of that Island, for a Surrendery of these five\\n_English_ Prisoners then in the Castle; but he not only peremptorily\\nexcused himself from it, as a Matter out of his Power, without particular\\nDirection from the Court of _Portugal_; but withal insinuated, that they\\nhad only taken Refuge there from the Hardships and Severity they had met\\nwith from their Master. The manner of Denial, and the avaritious Temper of\\nthe Gentleman, which I had Occasion to be acquainted with, makes it very\\nsuspicious, that he proposed considerable Gains to himself; for if Mr.\\n_Rowry_ had not made such an Escape to him, the Slaves had been his for\\nlittle or nothing, as a Bribe to silence his Suspicions, which any Man,\\nless acute than he, must have had from the awkward and unskilful Carriage\\nof such Merchants. But enough of this; perhaps he is not the only Governor\\nabroad that finds an Interest in countenancing these Fellows.\\n\\n[Footnote *: Term for stealing of Men used all over the Coast.]\\n\\nAn Account of the Pyracies and Murders committed by _Philip Roche_,\\n_&c._\\n\\nP_Hilip Roche_ was born in _Ireland_, and from his Youth had been\\nbred up to the Sea; he was a brisk genteel Fellow, of 30 Years of Age at\\nthe Time of his Death; one whose black and savage Nature did no ways answer\\nthe Comliness of his Person, his Life being almost one continued Scene of\\nVillany, before he was discovered to have committed the horrid Murders we\\nare now speaking of.\\n\\nThis inhumane Monster had been concerned with others, in insuring Ships to\\na great Value, and then destroying them; by which Means, and other\\nRogueries, he had got a little Money; and being Mate of a Ship, was\\ndilligent enough in trading for himself between _Ireland_ and _France_, so\\nthat he was in a Way of getting himself a comfortable Livelihood: But, as\\nhe resolved to be rich, and finding fair Dealing brought in Wealth but\\nslowly, he contriv'd to put other Things in Execution, and certainly had\\nmurthered several innocent Persons in the Prosecution of his abominable\\nSchemes; but as I have now forgot the particular Circumstances of those\\nRelations, I shall confine my self at present to the Fact for which he\\nsuffer'd.\\n\\n_Roche_ getting acquainted with one _Neal_, a Fisherman at _Cork_, whom he\\nfound ready for any villainous Attempt, he imparted his Design to him, who\\nbeing pleas'd with the Project, brings one _Pierce Cullen_ and his Brother\\ninto the Confederacy, together with one _Wise_, who at first was very\\nunwilling to come into their Measures, and, indeed, had the least Hand in\\nthe Perpetration of what follows.\\n\\nThey pitch'd upon a Vessel in the Harbour, belonging to _Peter Tartoue_, a\\n_French_ Man, to execute their cruel Intentions upon, because it was a\\nsmall one, and had not a great Number of Hands on Board, and 'twas easy\\nafterwards to exchange it for one more fit for Pyracy; and therefore they\\napply'd themselves to the Master of her, for a Passage to _Nantz_, whereto\\nthe Ship was bound; and accordingly, the Beginning of _November_ 1721, they\\nwent aboard; and when at Sea, _Philip Roche_ being an experienced Sailor,\\nthe Master of the Vessel readily trusted him with the Care of her, at\\ntimes, while he and the Mate went to rest.\\n\\nThe 15th of _November_, at Night, was the Time designed for the Tragedy;\\nbut _Francis Wise_ relented, and appear'd desirous to divert them from\\ntheir bloody Purposes. _Roche_ (sometimes called Captain) told him, _That\\nas_ Cullen _and he had sustained great Losses at Sea, unless every_\\nIrishman _present would assist in repairing their Losses, by murthering all\\nthe_ French _Rogues, and running away with the Ship, he should suffer the\\nsame Fate with the_ French _Men; but if all would assist, all should have a\\nShare in the Booty._ Upon this, they all resolved alike, and Captain\\n_Roche_ ordered three _Frenchmen_ and a Boy up to hand the Topsails, the\\nMaster and Mate being then asleep in their Cabins, The two first that came\\ndown, they beat out their Brains and threw them over-board: The other two\\nseeing what was done, ran up to the Topmast Head, but _Cullen_ followed\\nthem, and taking the Boy by the Arm, tost him into the Sea; then driving\\ndown the Man, those below knocked him on the Head, and threw him\\nover-board.\\n\\nThose who were asleep, being awakened by the dismal Skrieks and Groans of\\ndying Men, ran upon Deck in Confusion, to enquire into the Cause of such\\nunusual Noises; but the same Cruelty was immediately acted towards them,\\ne'er they could be sensible of the Danger that threat'ned them.\\n\\nThey were now (as _Roche_ himself afterwards confess'd) _all over as wet\\nwith the Blood that had been spilt, as if they had been dipp'd in Water, or\\nstood in a Shower of Rain, nor did they regard it any more. Roche_ said,\\nCaptain _Tartoue_ used many Words for Mercy, and asked them, if he had not\\nused them with Civility and Kindness? If they were not of the same\\nChristian Religion, and owned the same blessed _Jesus_, and the like? But\\nthey, not regarding what he said, took Cords and bound the poor Master and\\nhis Mate Back to Back, and while that was doing, both of them begged with\\nthe utmost Earnestness, and used the most solemn Intreaties, that they\\nwould at least allow them a few Minutes to say their Prayers, and beg Mercy\\nof God for the various Sins and Offences of their Lives: But it did not\\nmove them, (though all the rest were dead, and no Danger could be\\napprehended from them two alone) for the bound Persons were hurry'd up and\\nthrown into the Sea.\\n\\nThe Massacre being finished, they washed themselves a little from the\\nBlood, and searched the Chests and Lockers, and all Places about the Ship,\\nand then set down in the Captain's Cabin, and refreshed themselves with\\nsome Rum they found there, and (as _Roche_ confessed) were never merrier in\\ntheir Lives. They invested _Roche_ with the Command of the Ship, and\\ncalling him Captain, talked over their Liquor, what rare Actions they would\\nperform about Cape _Briton, Sable Isle_, and the Banks of _Newfoundland_,\\nwhither they designed to go as soon as they had recruited their Company,\\nand got a better Ship, which they proposed speedily to do.\\n\\n_Roche_ taking upon himself the Command of the Vessel, _Andrew Cullen_ was\\nto pass for a Merchant or Super-cargo; but when they bethought themselves,\\nthat they were in Danger of being discovered by the Papers of the Ship,\\nrelating to the Cargo, as Bills of Lading, _&c._ therefore they erase and\\ntake out the Name of the _French_ Master, and instead thereof, inserted the\\nName of _Roche_, so that it stood in the Ship's Papers, _Peter Roche_\\nMaster; that then having so few Hands on Board, they contrived if they met\\nany Ships, to give out, that they had lost some Hands by their being washed\\noverboard in a Storm, and by that Means screen themselves from being\\nsuspected of having committed some such wicked Act, by Reason of the\\nFewness of their Hands on Board; and also might prevail with some Ship to\\nspare them some, on Consideration of their pretended Disaster.\\n\\nIn going to _Cales_ they were in Distress by the Weather, and being near\\n_Lisbon_, they made Complaint to a Ship, but obtained no Assistance. They\\nwere then obliged to sail back for _England_, and put into the Port of\\n_Dartmouth_; but then they were in fear least they might be discovered,\\ntherefore to prevent that, they resolve to alter the Ship, and getting\\nWorkmen, they take down the Mizzen-Mast, and build a Spar Deck, and made\\nRails, (on pretence that the Sailors had been wash'd overboard) to secure\\nthe Men. Then they took down the Image of St. _Peter_ at the Head of the\\nShip, and put up a Lion in its Place, and painted over the Stern of the\\nShip with Red, and new nam'd her the _Mary_ Snow. The Ship being thus\\nalter'd that they thought it could not be known, they fancy'd themselves\\npretty secure; but wanting Money to defray the Charge of these Alterations,\\n_Roche_, as Master of the Vessel, and _Andrew Cullen_, as Merchant, apply\\nthemselves to the Officers of the Customs for Liberty to dispose of some of\\nthe Cargo, in order to pay the Workmen; which they having obtained, they\\nsold fifty eight Barrels of Beef, and having hired three more Hands, they\\nset Sail for _Ostend_, and there having sold more Barrels of Beef, they\\nsteer their Course to _Rotterdam_, dispose of the rest of the Cargo, and\\ntook in one Mr. _Annesly_, who freighted the Ship for _England_; but in\\ntheir Passage, in a stormy Night, it being very dark, they took up Mr.\\n_Annesly_ their Passenger, and threw him into the Sea, who swam about the\\nShip a pretty while, calling out for Life, and telling them they should\\nhave all his Goods, if they would receive him again into the Vessel: But in\\nvain were his Cries!\\n\\nAfter this, they were obliged to put into several Ports, and by contrary\\nWinds, came to the Coast of _France_, and hearing there was an Enquiry made\\nafter the Ship, _Roche_ quits her at _Havre de Grace_, and leaves the\\nManagement to _Cullen_ and the rest; who having shipp'd other Men, sail'd\\naway to _Scotland_, and there quitted the Vessel, which was afterwards\\nseized and brought into the River of _Thames._\\n\\nSome Time after this, _Philip Roche_ came to _London_, and making some\\nClaim for Money, he had made Insurance of, in the Name of _John Eustace_,\\nthe Officer was apprized of the Fraud, and he arrested and flung into the\\nCompter; from whence directing a Letter to his Wife, she shewed it to a\\nFriend, who discovered by it, that he was the principal Villain concerned\\nin the Destruction of _Peter Tartoue_, and the Crew. Upon this, an\\nInformation was given to my Lord _Carteret_, that the Person who went by\\nthe Name of _John Eustace_, was _Philip Roche_, as aforesaid; and being\\nbrought down by his Lordships Warrant, he stifly deny'd it for some Time,\\nnotwithstanding a Letter was found in his Pocket, directed to him by the\\nName of _Roche_; but being confronted by a Captain of a Ship, who knew him\\nwell, he confessed it, but prevaricated in several Particulars; whereupon\\nhe was committed to _Newgate_ upon violent Suspicion, and the next Day was\\nbrought down again at his own Request, confessed the whole, desired to be\\nmade an Evidence, and promised to convict three Men worse than himself. Two\\nwere discovered by him, who died miserably in the _Marshalsea_, and _Roche_\\nhimself was afterwards try'd, (no more being taken,) found Guilty of the\\nPyracy, and executed.\\n\\nAn ABSTRACT of the Civil Law and Statute Law now in Force, in Relation\\nto Pyracy.\\n\\nA _Pyrate is_ Hostis humanis generis, _a common Enemy, with whom\\nneither Faith nor Oath is to be kept, according to_ Tully. _And by the Laws\\nof Nature, Princes and States are responsible for their Neglect, if they do\\nnot provide Remedies for restraining these sort of Robberies. Though\\nPyrates are called common Enemies, yet they are properly not to be term'd\\nso. He is only to be honour'd with that Name, says_ Cicero, _who hath a\\nCommonwealth, a Court, a Treasury, Consent and Concord of Citizens, and\\nsome Way, if Occasion be, of Peace and League: But when they have reduced\\nthemselves into a Government or State, as those of_ Algier, Sally, Tripoly,\\nTunis, _and the like, they then are allowed the Solemnities of War, and the\\nRights of Legation._\\n\\n_If Letters of_ Marque _be granted to a Merchant, and he furnishes out a\\nShip, with a Captain and Mariners, and they, instead of taking the Goods,\\nor Ships of that Nation against whom their Commission is awarded, take the\\nShip and Goods of a Friend, this is Pyracy; and if the Ship arrive in any\\nPart of his Majesty's Dominions, it will be seized, and for ever lost to\\nthe Owners; but they are no way liable to make Satisfaction._\\n\\n_If a Ship is assaulted and taken by the Pyrates, for Redemption of which,\\nthe Master becomes a Slave to the Captors, by the Law_ Marine, _the Ship\\nand Lading are tacitly obliged for his Redemption, by a general\\nContribution; but if it happen through his own Folly, then no Contribution\\nis to be made._\\n\\n_If Subjects in Enmity with the Crown of_ England, _are abord an_ English\\n_Pyrate, in Company with_ English, _and a Robbery is committed, and they\\nare taken; it is Felony in the_ English, _but not in the Stranger; for it\\nwas no Pyracy in them, but the Depredation of an Enemy, and they will be\\ntried by a Martial Law._\\n\\n_If Pyracy is committed by Subjects in Enmity with_ England, _upon the_\\nBritish _Seas, it is properly only punishable by the Crown of_ England,\\n_who have_ istud regimen & Dominem _exclusive of all other Power._\\n\\n_If Pyracy be committed on the Ocean, and the Pyrates in the Attempt be\\novercome, the Captors may, without any Solemnity of Condemnation, hang them\\nup at the Main-Yard; if they are brought to the next Port, and the Judge\\nrejects the Tryal, or the Captors cannot wait for the Judge, without Peril\\nor Loss, Justice may be done upon them by the Captors._\\n\\n_If Merchandize be delivered to a Master, to carry to one Port, and he\\ncarries it to another, and sells and disposes of it, this is not Felony;\\nbut if, after unlading it at the first Port, he retakes it, it is Pyracy._\\n\\n_If a Pyrate attack a Ship, and the Master for Redemption, gives his Oath\\nto pay a Sum of Money, tho' there be nothing taken, yet it is Pyracy by the\\nLaw_ Marine.\\n\\n_If a Ship is riding at Anchor, and the Mariners all ashore, and a Pyrate\\nattack her, and rob her, this is Pyracy._\\n\\n_If a Man commit Pyracy upon the Subjects of any Prince, or Republick_,\\n(_though in Amity with us,) and brings the Goods into_ England, _and sells\\nthem in a Market_ Overt, _the same shall bind, and the Owners are for ever\\nexcluded._\\n\\n_If a Pyrate enters a Port of this Kingdom, and robs a Ship at Anchor\\nthere, it is not Pyracy, because not done_, super altum Mare; _but is\\nRobbery at common Law, because_ infra Corpus Comitatus. _A Pardon of all\\nFelonies does not extend to Pyracy, but the same ought to be especially\\nnamed._\\n\\n_By_ 28 H. 8. _Murthers and Robberies committed upon the Sea, or in other\\nPlaces, where the Admiral pretends Jurisdiction, shall be enquired into,\\ntry'd, heard, and determined, in such Places and Counties within the Realm,\\nas shall be limited by the King's Commission, in like Manner as if such\\nOffences were done at Land.

Also\\nthe Tryal of such Offences_ (_if they be denied_) _shall be had by twelve\\nMen of the County, limited in the said Commission_, (_as aforesaid_,) _and\\nno Challenge shall be had for the Hundred: And such as shall be convict of\\nsuch Offences, shall suffer Death without Benefit of Clergy, and forfeit\\nLand and Goods, as in Case of Felonies and Murders done at Land._\\n\\n_This Act shall not prejudice any Person, or Persons_, (_urged by\\nNecessity_) _for taking Victuals, Cables, Ropes, Anchors or Sails, out of\\nanother Ship that may spare them, so as they either pay ready Money, or\\nMoney worth for them, or give a Bill for the Payment thereof; if on this\\nSide the Straits of_ Gibraltar, _within four Months; if beyond, within\\ntwelve Months._\\n\\n_When any such Commission shall be sent to any Place within the\\nJurisdiction of the_ Cinque-Ports, _it shall be directed to the Warden of\\nthe said Ports, or his Deputy with three or four other Persons, as the Lord\\nChancellor shall Name; and the Inquisition or Tryal of such Offences,\\nthere, shall be made and had, by the Inhabitants of the said Ports, and\\nMembers of the same._\\n\\n_By_ 11 _and_ 12 W. 3. c. 7. _If any natural born Subjects or Denizons of_\\nEngland, _commit Pyracy, or any Act of Hostility, against his Majesty's\\nSubjects at Sea, under Colour of a Commission or Authority, from any\\nforeign Prince or State, or Person whatsoever, such Offenders shall be\\nadjudged Pyrates._\\n\\n_If any Commander or Master of a Ship, or Seaman or Mariner, give up his\\nShip_, &c. _to Pyrates, or combine to yield up, or run away with any Ship,\\nor lay violent Hand on his Commander, or endeavour to make a Revolt in the\\nShip, he shall be adjudged a Pyrate._\\n\\n_All Persons who after the_ 29_th of_ September 1720, _shall set forth any\\nPyrate (or be aiding and assisting to any such Pyrate_,) _committing Pyracy\\non Land or Sea, or shall conceal such Pyrates, or receive any Vessel or\\nGoods pyratically taken, shall be adjudged accessary to such Pyracy, and\\nsuffer as Principals._\\n\\n_By_ 4 G. c. 11.
