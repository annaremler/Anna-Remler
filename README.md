# ELizabethean Appalachian.
Digital Humanities project (2021)

#Description of Project.
  There is a belief that if you want to know what Shakespeare sounded like you would find it in America. There have been some arguments that that's in the South, especially in places like the Great Dismal Swamps of North Carolina and the mountains of Appalachia. In both places, communities have been largely cut off from the rest of the country by the terrains. Specifically, these regions filled with people in the tide of initial immigrants from England but then were passed by by later waves.
  The data that I'm using was collected by Cecil Sharp and his assistant Maud Karpeles, who from 1916 to 1918 spent their time recording and transcribing music that had roots in England. While there are issues of potential bias, it is the closest, if not only source, that we have in the modern era to test the theory of Elizabethan English in the US. Soon after their work, radios would become popular roads will be built and the world would modernize and globalize rapidly. The isolation pf these areas vanished, and they became quite quickly integrated into the Great American landscape, and therefore losing many of the unique elements that came from lack of contact. Obviously, radio in particular, change the language they were exposed to: vocabulary, pronunciation and syntax.
  
#Tools used.
For this project, I mainly used Doc2Vec and Gensim (though I did a wordcloud for context).


My data live in a [Google Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/16kM4r5WIdLDPdI8C_5eO1LaIr0ix3PBF?usp=sharing)
